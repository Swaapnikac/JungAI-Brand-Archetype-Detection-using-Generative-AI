"Won Pcar auction. Got scammed. What would you do? Long story short ‚Äî I won an auction for an EV converted 74‚Äô Targa. Interesting concept. Loved the speed and torque from the 550hp Tesla motor. Upon inspection it was in good working condition but after a few longer rides, it was a world of problems. The seller lied about the cooling system and installed it himself (hidden flaws) which led to over heating issues. The motor was already coolant logged and the overheating amplified the issues causing a full motor melt down. The BMS was installed incorrectly, no weather proofing on HV components‚Ä¶ etc etc. It‚Äôs been a 6 month long nightmare and apparently this thing is set up so badly that 3 highly skilled EV technicians here in Los Angeles all said it is a surprise that the car has not gone up in flames yet. The batteries can take a charge but the shut off isn‚Äôt installed correctly, so this set up can over charge real fast. https://www.pcarmarket.com/auction/marketplace-1974-porsche-911-targa-13/ In trying to get this thing moving, I put in a brand new Tesla motor, added a few bmss satellites, fixed the coolant system, and weather proofed the HV components. Partially it‚Äôs my fault not knowing enough about EV conversions, not having the right eyes on the car before buying, and trusting the seller at his word. I‚Äôm assuming I can‚Äôt sue him for false representation. I‚Äôm now stuck with a dilemma. Do I part out the EV components and put in a motor to try and get some resale value out of the car?

"Tesla‚Äôs Financial Death Spiral in 10 Points (My Understanding) 1. **Tesla thought of itself as ""the Apple of cars.""** Why do people line up for Apple products on launch day? Because they know Apple doesn't cut prices later, so there‚Äôs no advantage in waiting. If you wait, you miss out on being part of the story. Elon Musk expected Tesla to follow the same model. He believed customers would willingly pay premium prices, trusting that their cars would hold their value for years. And for a while, it was true. 2. **Tesla built its entire financial model around stronger than resale values.** They leased and financed many vehicles themselves, planning to resell them after leases ended at high prices. From an accounting perspective, Tesla owns tens or even hundreds of thousands of cars, which it records as valuable assets on its balance sheet. They then leverage these assets to secure loans, relying heavily on the assumption that these assets would maintain their value. 3. **But competition increased, and Tesla started cutting prices.** Unlike Apple, Tesla started cutting prices to boost sales. This encouraged customers to delay purchases, expecting future discounts rather than buying immediately. For Reddit mods, here is another analogy (joke): People buy Nintendo games at launch because they know waiting won‚Äôt get them a better deal. Steam, on the other hand, runs massive sales all the time, so people hold off on buying games until prices drop. Nobody wants to be the sucker who paid full price right before a discount. 4. **These price cuts severely damaged the resale value of used Teslas.** For example, if a new Model Y suddenly dropped from $60,000 to $55,000, the resale value of older Teslas immediately fell as well. Why would someone pay a high price for a used car if a new one is only slightly more expensive? 5. **Tesla‚Äôs brand then became increasingly stigmatized due to Elon Musk‚Äôs actions.** Here is where the downward spiral begins. Musk‚Äôs controversial public behavior, including gestures resembling Nazi salutes, provocative political statements, and polarizing opinions, made owning a Tesla socially uncomfortable for many average buyers. 6. **This stigma pushed Tesla owners to rush to sell their cars.** Some owners experienced vandalism, such as swastikas painted on their cars, or even arson attacks. At best, Tesla owners might get disapproving looks or comments, leading many to sell quickly, even at significant financial losses. Normies don't want to deal with the stigma, so they are OK making a loss. 7. **As a result, the used car market is now flooded with cheap Teslas.** Because so many owners urgently want to sell, platforms like Kijiji have become overloaded with heavily discounted Teslas. This oversupply creates a race to the bottom, further depressing prices. 8. **Tesla itself is now financially trapped.** Remember, Tesla still owns tens or even hundreds of thousands of these cars through their leasing program. Imagine that Tesla originally assumed a leased Model Y would be worth around $35,000 after three years, according to their financial projections. Now, however, the market values that same car at closer to $25,000 or even less. 9. **Every car sold below Tesla‚Äôs original projection creates direct financial losses.** If Tesla loses roughly $10,000 on each returned leased vehicle because it's worth far less than expected, these losses quickly multiply into billions of dollars across their portfolio. And at some point, they will have to report that loss to investors. 10. **Tesla is now caught in a dangerous financial death spiral.** The more stigmatized the brand becomes, the cheaper used Teslas become. As used car prices continue to fall, Tesla must cut new car prices even further to compete. Why would someone buy an expensive new Tesla when the market is flooded with cheap used ones? Lower prices for new cars push used car prices even lower, perpetuating the cycle.

"Season 21 Abilities Tuning Preview Source: https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/s21_abilities_tuning --- Hey folks. Combat Gameplay team here to talk about the near future of Destiny abilities tuning. It‚Äôs been a very busy year with a lot of change in the abilities sandbox‚Äîthe Subclass 3.0 conversion of Void, Solar, and Arc, followed up by the brand-new Strand subclass‚Äîso we‚Äôre taking this opportunity to evaluate the state of our subclasses and systems, focusing on adjusting abilities that are either overshooting or not quite hitting our power bar. Today we‚Äôll be going through an update to Fragment slot allotments on a selection of Aspects, PvE-focused improvements to roaming Supers, and general balance updates across our subclass suite. With Season 21‚Äôs ability tuning pass, these are our high-level goals: * Increase viability of roaming Supers in high-difficulty PvE content. * Incorporate subclass keywords into a selection of Light subclass Supers. * Reduce the amount of unlimited uptime mobility available in the Crucible. * Increase buildcrafting capabilities of a selection of Stasis and Light subclass Aspects. Let‚Äôs get into it. [Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/bltc711dce7b1670f7b/64517cf1e7d018114c01cb80/230502_SA_Ability_Filler_Asset.jpg) ###FRAGMENT BUDGET REVIEW Over the last year, we‚Äôve consistently heard feedback that single-Fragment-slot Aspects feel restrictive to player buildcrafting freedom. Fragment slots are a critical balancing lever that we intend to continue to use to control Aspect potency, but we don‚Äôt feel that any of the current single-Fragment-slot Aspects are overperforming to the point of restricting them to a single slot, and so with Season 21 we‚Äôre increasing them to two. To set expectations now, we are not committing to a minimum budget of two Fragment slots for future Aspects, and we may change these slot allotments in the future. As we monitor the affected Aspects‚Äô performance following this change, additional updates to their potency level should be expected. * Increased the Fragment slot allotment for the following Aspects from 1 to 2: * Hunter * Trapper‚Äôs Ambush * Shatterdive * Gunpowder Gamble * Titan * Bastion * Juggernaut * Warlock * Chaos Accelerant [Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/blt748baeb8b01bdaf6/64517d56d5d03c0794f169c9/5_2022_Season_of_the_Seraph_PressKit_Story_Intro_COMPRESSED_008.jpg) ###SUPER TUNING UPDATES With Lightfall‚Äôs release came two new roaming Supers, Silkstrike and Bladefury. The tuning on these Supers was an experiment to determine where we felt roaming Supers could live in the combat sandbox. We‚Äôre pretty happy with the results, and with Season 21 we‚Äôre taking a pass at other roaming Supers (as well as some underperforming burst Supers) to increase their viability. While there is too much nuance in the Destiny sandbox to completely equalize the performance of something as diverse as our suite of Supers, our hope is that this puts them on a more level playing field. One of the ways we‚Äôre working to increase that viability is through damage resistance. In addition to the damage resistance values that Supers have against other players, all Supers have additional intrinsic damage resistance against PvE combatants, which we‚Äôre increasing. With this change, our goal is that Supers‚Äîin particular melee Supers‚Äîare more easily able to engage with targets in high-difficulty content. * All Supers * Increased PvE damage resistance by ~20%. In our initial Subclass 3.0 conversion we opted not to include subclass keyword integration (e.g. Jolt, Scorch, etc) into most Supers, but now that the dust has settled, we are revisiting that idea. With Season 21, we‚Äôre taking a pass at the roster and adding intrinsic keyword behaviors where their inclusion makes sense. Unlike existing interactions such as Arc Staff with Lethal Current, or Sentinel Shield with Controlled Demolition, these will be baked into the",Rebel,Tesla,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/136t16q/season_21_abilities_tuning_preview/
"Why I sold my Tesla Model 3 Performance &amp; went back to gas I owned a 2019 Tesla Model 3 Performance for roughly two years and 15,000 miles. I'm going to distill my key learnings and experiences here, in an attempt to educate others on EVs and reach some form of closure. My ownership could best be summed-up as a love/hate relationship, ending with crazy used car values offering me the out I'd been quietly seeking. Clearly, I decided EVs aren't for me - at least, not yet. I'm not a ""paid big oil shill"" or someone who's trying to short the stock, as I'm sure some of the Tesla nuts will claim. I'm just a car enthusiast (disclaimer: not an engineer) standing at the same crossroads as the rest of you, wondering what sounds future children will make long after (if?) our beloved bureaucrats outlaw the ICE. Everything I'm writing here is based on my own unique tastes and preferences. How the pros and cons balance out at the end is entirely up to you. And that's fine. Choice is great. Note that this post centers on Battery EVs (BEVs) at the time of this writing, which comprise the vast majority of EVs on the road today. And yeah. This got way longer than I anticipated. But it was cathartic for me and I hope it's at least somewhat useful to someone out there. # EV performance &amp; its accessibility I'll start with what ultimately sold me on the car - **Immense, instant power.** The war in the ""pure acceleration"" category is pretty much over - just take a look at Jason Cammisa's video with the Model S Plaid vs. the BMW M5 CS and Cadillac Crazy. They're not even on the same planet. Not only is the acceleration brutal, but it's consistent (everything else held constant - more on that later). Look up any number of 0 - 60 videos on YouTube, and you'll notice that the times are all remarkably close, especially if there are multiple runs in the same video. And how could they not be? Software and traction control are fundamental to EV operation. Adjustments take mere milliseconds. The amount of ""stuff"" involved between your right foot and the tires is a joke compared to an ICE car. And it's basically idiot-proof - even with the Track Mode dialed to 100% hoon in my TM3P, it was nearly impossible to make a mistake. You just put your foot down and the car takes care of the rest, with literally zero drama. # Electric motors are great And all of this performance comes with no mechanical sympathy. I never felt an ounce of it, flogging my Model 3 - there's really nothing to ""break"" mechanically in the way of the drivetrain. The entire drive unit consists of the motor, a few gears, the diff, a pump to circulate the oil... and that's really about it. No fried clutches, exploding transmissions, shredded differentials, etc... it's always ready to pounce at any speed, in any situation. Electric motors themselves are relatively inexpensive, quiet, clean, tough, extremely efficient, insanely long-lasting, and have an excellent power/size ratio. When it comes to to the task of turning energy into mechanical force, I'm not sure there's anything better. AND! You don't even have to worry about getting the motors up to operating temperature before you get on it. During the colder months, it easily takes 10+ minutes of highway driving for the oil of an ICE to warm up (you are looking at your oil and not the coolant temp, right?). I quite enjoyed leaving my neighborhood with the ability to give it full ""throttle"" right out of the gate. It's like teleporting straight into any 3-car gap, no matter where. (But there are limitations to this - more on that later, too.) # Convenience &amp; running costs You can also have your cake and eat it, too! There's no need to feel like a moron with a 550 HP ICE engine idling under the hood in daily stop and go traffic. My TM3P was an efficient, calm, quiet, easy, comfortable way of getting from Point A to Point B while being more similar performance-wise to a BMW M3 than a Toyota Corolla - with fewer running costs than either.",Rebel,Tesla,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/rshvy0/why_i_sold_my_tesla_model_3_performance_went_back/
"Tesla short thesis and the U.S. market (House of Cards) pending crash Hello Fellow Apes (I use this term affectionately‚Äîdon‚Äôt take it too seriously), I‚Äôve been seeing a flood of posts about Tesla lately, and I‚Äôll admit‚ÄîI‚Äôm feeling the FOMO. But instead of just jumping in impulsively, I wanted to take a step back and explore the broader implications of what‚Äôs happening with Tesla and the U.S. market as a whole. Now, I‚Äôm not claiming to have all the answers. In fact, I know that no one person can fully grasp the entire landscape‚Äîthere are just too many moving parts. That‚Äôs exactly why we‚Äôre here: to exchange ideas, challenge assumptions, and grow smarter together. If you think I‚Äôve got something wrong, by all means, correct me‚ÄîI welcome it. With that said, I‚Äôll get straight to the point: like many of you, I believe Tesla‚Äôs current stock price is inflated beyond what makes sense for a car company. That‚Äôs not up for debate in my view. The real question is when it‚Äôs going to come back down to earth. I think some of the hardcore short sellers may have shown up too early to the party. Yes, they‚Äôre making noise and causing some damage, but it‚Äôs still early days. The key reason? Elon and Trump still have enough firepower‚Äîboth financial and cultural‚Äîto prop this thing up, at least for the short term. Between their loyal fanbases and their connections to wealthy, influential backers, they‚Äôre capable of swinging retail sentiment when needed.

That‚Äôs the stage where the stock experiences one final upward thrust before demand dries up and the markdown phase begins. We won‚Äôt be able to confirm this until after the fact, but this setup suggests there may still be one last upswing before reality sets in. And let‚Äôs not forget how easily Elon and Trump can manufacture short-term narratives to keep the hype train rolling. For example: 1. Elon announces a new, cheaper model with an overly optimistic delivery timeline. 2. Trump announces plans to transition the federal vehicle fleet to Teslas. 3. A surprise decision is made to standardize all federal charging stations to Tesla‚Äôs NAC. 4. Suddenly, a new mandate appears‚Äîevery automaker must adopt the NAC standard ‚Äúby tomorrow.‚Äù 5, Tesla remains the only EV maker eligible for tax credits, while competitors lose out. All hypothetical, of course‚Äîbut not far-fetched. These kinds of announcements, even if temporary or empty promises, are more than enough to juice the stock price and keep hope alive a little longer. But here‚Äôs the thing: this won‚Äôt work in the long run. The brand itself is becoming radioactive. Tesla is quickly approaching the kind of cultural toxicity we associate with names like ‚ÄúAdolf‚Äù or the toothbrush mustache. No matter how much mental gymnastics some bagholders perform, you can‚Äôt deny the rot underneath. The company has shown no real innovation, has no competitive moat, and has been delivering nothing but negative headlines for months. 1. Tesla's stock has experienced a significant decline of nearly 50% in three months, reducing its market capitalization from an all-time high of $1.5 trillion to $845 billion.

"Traded in the Tesla Not political, but influenced by Musk. *Edit 2: It‚Äôs been 24hrs since this post got attention and now that the initial interest has died down the quizlings have creeped out to piss and moan, lol. Predictable as a trip to the toilet the morning after a heavy meal, and about as meaningful.* Bought our Model 3 shortly after Mohammed Bin Saud had Jamal Khashoggi butchered alive. That was the ‚Äúlet‚Äôs see if we can stop buying oil‚Äù moment in our family. And it worked! Car was great: cheap to fuel, low maintenance, easy road trips. When we bought it there was a real risk of bankruptcy, so it was great to survive that and learn that we love EVs and expect to drive them forever. Musk acted the fool and was clearly a shyster about FSD but at the time that was a sideshow, and the establishment of a credible EV market was appreciated. We paid off the car, didn‚Äôt send Tesla any more money besides the occasional supercharging fee, and ignored the weird stories. We had planned to hold the car for another 2-4 years and then trade in for something newer. A few years ago as he went bananas during COVID we were convinced that a new Tesla was not an option. But still the decision to sell was years away. Then he became a Nutzi and began doing everything you see now. We kept our heads down, not really in the market for a new car and long since done with supporting Tesla in any meaningful way. Still didn‚Äôt expect to sell anytime soon. Last week it hit me: The resale market and eventual trade in value for this car could fall off a cliff at any time. There‚Äôs no telling what lunatic antics Musk could further debase himself with. Our car could become completely unsellable - as customers reject the brand at all levels. The dealers we visited confirmed this - they have been flooded with Tesla trade ins here (SoCal). The secondhand market is ballooning and it remains to be seen if there‚Äôs any demand. We traded in for a car with real suspension (yay!) Apple CarPlay (yay!) and no affiliation with Elon Musk (double yay!). It outperforms our old car in every metric - no surprise there - and at sticker price lower than we paid for the Model 3. If you‚Äôre on the fence about selling my advice is this: There are great deals to be had everywhere, the competition has fully eroded Tesla‚Äôs original advantage, and it‚Äôs not very expensive to make the swap. tl/dr: Traded in our Tesla for a competitor with better features. Affordable and highly recommended. edit to add - I know it would be more helpful to hear about what we got instead of the Tesla but for various reasons I am not able to do that. We bought a competitor EV. Our new car is bigger, with more range*, and cheaper than what we paid for the Model 3. We got $22k in trade and paid an additional $2.5k cash. *We got the novelty ‚ÄúMid Range‚Äù Model 3 which existed for about 6 months. It was always the ugly duckling on range, which didn‚Äôt affect us much, but it means getting a car with more range was pretty easy for us to find.",Rebel,Tesla,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTesla/comments/1j29zke/traded_in_the_tesla/

This comment caught me by surprise because the numbers were totally made up. I have to go back and do some research because what he said wasn't true at all. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Tesla's net income was $2.31 billion on revenues of $25.7 billion. During this period, the company earned $692 million from selling automotive regulatory credits. This revenue from regulatory credits represents approximately 30% of Tesla's net income for the quarter. [https://www.statista.com/statistics/1553187/revenue-of-tesla-regulatory-credits-by-quarter/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1553187/revenue-of-tesla-regulatory-credits-by-quarter/) Tesla reported a 47% increase in 2024, totaling $1.57 billion for the year, up from $1.07 billion in 2023. While the exact figure for Q4 2024 isn't specified, if we assume the increase was evenly distributed, the quarterly interest income would be around $392.5 million. This would account for approximately 17% of the quarter's net income. Combining both regulatory credits and estimated interest income, these sources contributed approximately 47% of Tesla's net income in Q4 2024. The 70% is false information.

These are *not actual cars sold*‚Äîthey're a kind of *bonus revenue* Tesla earns because of how environmentally friendly its cars are. Governments around the world, especially in places like California and Europe, require automakers to sell a certain number of low-emission or zero-emission vehicles. If a car company doesn‚Äôt meet those requirements, they have to *buy credits* from companies that exceed the standard‚Äîlike Tesla. Tesla earns a bunch of these credits because all its cars are electric.

"The GameStop Market Hedge Thesis. A comprehensive analysis using the data this sub has accumulated over the last 18 months This is going to be a long one. This analysis contains no memes, no hype dates, no cryptic tweet analysis, and minimal speculation based on known market mechanics. This is a cumulative fact-based report of what we know to-date. The abstract is the closest you will get to a TLDR. This is *The GameStop Market Hedge Thesis*. ##Abstract GameStop is primed for the biggest short squeeze the market has ever seen. **The January 2021 ‚ÄúSneeze‚Äù** section uses SEC reports to show that short covering was a small fraction of the buy volume in the sneeze. Massive short positions are open and hidden in ETFs and swaps which don't have to be reported. **Current Market Conditions** is speculative but shows strong signs of an impending recession and/or market downturn. **The GameStop Squeeze is Inevitable** shows the company is in good health and at no risk of bankruptcy. Borrow and utilization rates prove the stock is illiquid and hard to find. Negative beta is a strong indicator that GameStop tracks inverse to the market which is headed for a major downturn. Even with current reported SI and no hidden short positions GameStop is primed to move many multiples above its current market cap. ComputerShare DRS statistics provide proof of a closing exit for shorts to squeeze out of, day by day making it harder for them to close their positions entirely. _________________ #Why Short Squeezes Happen ##Prime Short Squeeze Conditions &gt;Short interest ratios tend to be quite low; for large non-financial stocks, they are often less than 2.5% whereas for small non-financial stocks they still tend to be less than 13%. **Few stocks, if any, have short interest greater than 50% on a given date.**^(76) Until recently, short interest of more than 90% was observed only a few times‚Äîin 2007 and 2008. When examining short interest as a percent of shares outstanding, **GME is the only stock that staff observed as having short interest of more than shares outstanding in January 2021.** [[SEC.gov Staff Report on Equity and Options Market Structure](https://www.sec.gov/files/staff-report-equity-options-market-struction-conditions-early-2021.pdf)] &gt;**Short squeezes tend to occur more often in smaller-cap stocks, which have a very small float** (supply), but large caps are certainly not immune to this situation.

"The apolitical billionaire messiah (CEO of GameStop) makes a ""Trump 2024"" tweet, thousands of comments are made on r/Superstonk as it tries to find out who's the real paid actor trying to inject politics into their movement to cause the greatest wealth transfer in history. I can't really accurately state in a title sentence how much of an impact this had to the apes, see for yourself in this post. **Background** r/Superstonk is a subreddit revolving around the GameStop (GME) stock, in the briefest possible explanation, the redditors (self described as **apes**) have a theory that as long as they keep buying and never selling the company's stock, the stock will eventually become worth billions of USD per individual stock. Ok, you think that sounds unrealistic and sounds a lot like cryptocurrency financial armageddon? Well, that's the outlook required to understand the fanaticism and conspiratorial thinking you're about to see. Some apes think that GameStop will do a turnaround play to be valued like the equivalent to Apple, but this is already seen as a soft-schism as redditors are tired of not seeing massive gains after 3.5 years. The CEO billionaire of GameStop, Ryan Cohen, has generally been seen as the [individual working behind the scenes through the power of 4D chess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGdhHwsAhb0) in ensuring the redditors get paid. His tweets are practically quoted as scripture for the apes to follow, for instance, you'll see a lot through this post about how ""ape no fight ape"" is supported on an interpretation of a few tweets, such as [""The hell with the left and the right. Stop dividing the people üíú""](https://x.com/ryancohen/status/1536396937338970112) Of course, with anyone familiar with this kind of thinking, it's far more likely he can be identified as a yellow libertarian, such as his views on [covid vaccination](https://np.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/13exo28/ryan_cohen_on_twitter/), [his view on ""insurrectionists""](https://np.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/vec4p5/ryan_cohen_tweet_power_to_the_players/), posing with [Javier Milei, president of Argentina](https://np.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1c133w8/ryan_cohen_ryancohen_on_x/), and now, 20 minutes after the shooting of Donald Trump, [Trump 2024 üá∫üá∏](https://x.com/ryancohen/status/1812259501665648873). He has [recently caused a noticeable division](https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1dbcd8x/a_schism_is_brewing_in_rsuperstonk_after_gamestop/) within the community through dilution of the stock, being accused of stopping the ape's chance of 'generational wealth'. While there is ongoing comment wars, the moderators have invoked the ""zero politics"" rule and have been deleting a lot of comments, so this is a sample of what's leftover. Other schisms of the ape movement have far more politics present, such as when [Vivek Ramaswamy appeared at a event focused on the ""possible merger"" between Bed-Bath-Beyond and GameStop event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTchjMunrbc), but that's a schism story for another time. **Drama time!** [**""RYAN COHEN on X"" (LOCKED, 60% upvote ratio with +5,251)**](https://np.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1e2n9cr/ryan_cohen_on_x/) Some apes are sad that Papa/Daddy cohen decided to tweet politics [""**RYAN COHEN IS OUR DAD**""](https://np.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1e2n9cr/ryan_cohen_on_x/ld2527u) &gt; Why daddy, why?

"GME POSSIBLE OVERSTOCK 2.0, overstock issued dividend and the stock sky rocketed due to short squeeze. Nothing written here is financial advice. I mean read my username. Edit just found this, how do you categorize that as a mistake?

My Counter to the above: game stop has the rewards program and game coin, they historically have always used exchange of value of games in trades like an exchange. So I would think they should be more than fine, it‚Äôs always been in their business model and GameStop previously paid a dividend so it‚Äôs not new grounds for them to enter into. However with overstock it was something completely brand new to them, so I could see it as kind of an issue. But companies are meant to grow and evolve, if you don‚Äôt you get replaced. They can‚Äôt stay a certain way just cause the guy shorting the stock says ‚Äúoh but your company only does this‚Äù business is always chAnging, you either pivot and survive or you stay the same like a fool and die.

"There aren't a lot of Model 3 reviews from ""traditional"" car enthusiasts, so I wrote my own While I know the Model 3 has been out for 2 years now, it seems a lot of reviews are from Tesla fans and not so much ‚Äútraditional‚Äù car enthusiasts, so I thought I‚Äôd write a review voicing my opinions. That, plus I want my thoughts recorded for my own posterity. For some time now, I‚Äôve been considering purchasing a Tesla Model 3. I‚Äôm generally a more frugal car enthusiast, and spending $39.9k on any other car would be nuts to me, but the Tesla at least on paper offers a lot to like: there‚Äôs of course the instant acceleration at any speed, but there‚Äôs also the super low CoG, lack of distractions in the cabin (so you can focus on driving!), no warm-up and cool-down procedures, OTA updates that occasionally bring performance and range increases, and no guilt associated with lots of unnecessary driving, which I personally do value. I was also very tempted by Autopilot, since there are times I just don‚Äôt care to drive and would be perfectly happy to let the car do the work. So, to assuage my curiosity, I rented a long-range RWD model for two days from Turo. I spent a couple minutes adjusting settings, drove off, and‚Ä¶ instantly hated it. Right off the bat: * I could not for the life of me get the seat into a comfortable position. The seat bottom was bolstered too much and cut into my thigh, the pressure on my back was awful no matter where I put the lumbar support, and the headrest intrudes forwards and *doesn‚Äôt adjust at all* so when sitting upright, your head actually touches the seat before your shoulders do. Try to put your shoulders against the seat too, and you end up sitting like a hunchback. I absolutely *hated* this, and despite frequently adjusting the seat throughout the two days, I couldn‚Äôt make it any better. * The driver‚Äôs mirror doesn‚Äôt adjust far enough out. I like to follow the recommended method for [eliminating blind spots]( https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a15131074/how-to-adjust-your-mirrors-to-avoid-blind-spots/) but couldn‚Äôt move the mirror far enough to do so. * The turn signal is BMW-style in that it doesn‚Äôt stay where you put it, but rather springs up after you press it so it‚Äôs impossible to tell what it‚Äôs doing by feel alone. Even BMW is reverting on this because it‚Äôs so awful. That said, I did eventually get used to it. * The car was dog slow. Punch it, and it accelerated at a Civic pace. I‚Äôve driven Teslas before, so I knew that wasn‚Äôt right. I eventually found out the car was in Chill Mode, and I fixed it. BUT, my time spent driving it in Chill Mode made me realize just how much of the enjoyment of this car is dependent on acceleration. Take away the acceleration, and you may as well be driving a slightly quieter Civic. But after getting to drive the car some more, I found there were definitely a number of things I liked: * Acceleration at most speeds was solid. While this was no P100D, it definitely has good low-end torque, and of course acceleration is uninterrupted by gear changes. I found it started to run out of steam after 60 or so, and there wasn‚Äôt much of anything left after 80. Still, great for darting around traffic. * The traction control is the best I‚Äôve ever encountered. While I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs possible to turn it off, I don‚Äôt really care: while you can feel it working, it‚Äôs very unobtrusive, and its purpose is more to help put the power down in low-traction situations than to limit power. A huge change from the TC in my Mazdaspeed3, which just cuts engine power at the first sign of wheelspin. * I like the interior overall. The lack of buttons encourages you to focus more on driving (though it does forego something I‚Äôll discuss towards the end), and the touch screen is very responsive with a mostly-intuitive layout. Materials were nice, but nothing special. The dash is soft touch, though it actually looks like hard plastic.

Therefore, I made the decision to compile a variety of things in which the United States excels, and I am confident that there are many more. I'm not american, this post is a response to those absolutely ridiculous takes you see on the Internet. 1 - Economy: The United States has the largest, most technologically powerful and innovative economy in the world. The U.S. dollar is the currency most used in international transactions and is the world's foremost reserve currency, backed by its economy, stable government, and military. New York City is the world's principal financial center. 2 - The US has the most powerful military in the world. 3 - The United States has a larger immigrant population than any other country in the world. Every year, millions of people come to the US in search of freedom and economic opportunities.

"Tesla increasing in value: what do you think? Title should rather be: **Avoiding model 3 depreciation thanks to Qu√©bec EV rebates ending. What do you think?** I'm about to buy a brand new 2024 model 3 (red ext., long range) because I'm hoping that its selling value in the short/medium term would stay relatively constant. I live in Qu√©bec, where we have access to a 12000$ rebate on a new electric vehicle and a 3500$ rebate on used EVs. As of April 1st 2025, 8000$ of that rebate is going to go away, leaving only a 4000$ rebate on brand-new EVs. Looking at the price that a 2024 model 3 sells for in Qu√©bec, there seems to be absolutely no difference with the original purchase price of my configuration (63 000$ net). Considering the price increase for someone looking to get a model 3 and the current low used offers, I'm thus hoping to sell the car in April 2025 and try to make a few grands off of it, or at least break even. Do you think that's realistic? I know that usually cars depreciate as soon as you walk out of the dealership, but I've also heard plenty of stories of people who were able to get a newer Tesla because they were offered more money than they paid for when initially buying it. Model 3 price changes are also to be taken into account here. As Robotaxi Day is coming on Oct. 10th with a potentially new affordable Tesla model at the beginning of next year, I would assume that model 3 prices would go up since it will no longer be the cheapest Tesla you can buy, which means Tesla would probably have to make a bigger price gap between their new affordable model and the model 3. Very curious to get thoughts on this. Edit: I **want** a model 3 anyway, and I really like the 2024 refresh. However, I don't see how paying 2x the price of a used one justifies the new features, hence why I'm trying to know if I will **at least break even** in the short to medium term. I **do not** see this as a real investment, as I'm only trying to avoid depreciation on the car.",Rebel,Tesla,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModel3/comments/1f06fji/tesla_increasing_in_value_what_do_you_think/
"$GGPI Polestar - Global EV Pure Play - DD Greetings, lads. Elon‚Äôs TweetThreats and PP posts aside, EV stocks are melting faces this month. Consider the following‚Ä¶ * Rivian IPO blew up.

It‚Äôs now coming to market at a $20B valuation with $GGPI in Q1 2022. Polestar is the only global EV ‚Äòpure play,‚Äô other than Tesla. &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/av4nl8i87d181.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68f1d78905547fea74ffaba96cd6265c7a4a33a8 **History** A little background‚Ä¶ * ‚ÄúPolestar‚Äù takes its name from the North Star, or Polaris ‚Äî not the resourceful co-ed grinding the early-evening shift at the Spearmint Rhino. That‚Äôs *Polstj√§rnan* (literal translation, ‚ÄúPole Star‚Äù) if you‚Äôre Swedish. * Polestar was started in 1996 by Volvo‚Äôs partner, Flash/Polestar Racing. * Volvo acquired Polestar in 2015. Volvo had itself been acquired in 2010 by Geely, a China-based auto brand that sells vehicles under the brands Geely Auto, Lotus, Lynk &amp; Co, Proton, and Volvo. Geely sold over 2.4 million cars in 2020. * Volvo and Geely describe the Polestar brand as being ‚Äúindependent since 2017.‚Äù * Polestar is co-owned by Volvo and Geely, and headquartered in Gothenburg, Sweden. * Polestar is now being taken public at a $20B valuation by the Gores-Guggenheim, ticker GGPI. **Comps** **GGPI is trading at a significant discount to TSLA and LCID, based on EV/sales multiples.** * Applying Tesla‚Äôs 2023E multiple to Polestar implies a share price of $42.51 As GGPI is currently trading at $13.72, this yields an increase of 210%. * Applying Lucid‚Äôs 2023E multiple to Polestar implies a share price of $47.58.

The CCP can theoretically shut them down at any moment without warning (see: $DIDI). 2. The stocks are actually ADRs and based in the Cayman Islands, so you don't even own the actual companies. * By comparison, GGPI is headquartered in Sweden and already US-listed on the Nasdaq. * Polestar is already an established OEM, leveraging the strategic relationship with Volvo in manufacturing, design and marketing. Hence, the investment opportunity is lower risk since Polestar is not a start-up. * As with most present-day multinationals, there is some China-related production risk. However, Polestar is addressing the issue by opening US factories going forward. https://preview.redd.it/n5mgt00e7d181.png?width=588&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7487924a42825ba052899aa03fc4fae3d1abe9ec **Gores' Deals** Gores‚Äô track record speaks for itself‚Ä¶ https://preview.redd.it/t1uq0jcg7d181.jpg?width=1972&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6571264d9347fd8f8c237881e1d511b8cca7fae **The EV Graveyard** The EV battlefield is littered with bodies.

"Time For a Controversial Investment Thread - I formatted Buddy Barkers Twitter thread for those looking for a more easily digestible version of his GME Fundamentals DD. # Time for a controversial investment thread Here's why I believe this company that ran over 700% in 2021 is one of the most misunderstood stocks in the market and could be comparable to buying Tesla $TSLA in early 2020. The company? **You guessed it, Gamestop. $GME** Everyone thought Tesla was/is an auto OEM. In reality, they're turning into a technology company that also sells cars. Gamestop is being pinned as a brick &amp; mortar retailer. In the future, Gamestop will be a technology first company, that also has a brick &amp; mortar business. I personally feel a ton of massive overperformers that wow people have been at the intersection of traditional industries/sectors, and technology. The ones people argue if they're a XX company or a technology company. Also, I'd like to say, I'm not an ""Ape"" nor is my investment thesis centered around a theoretical MOASS. To be clear, I'm not saying that won't happen. I'm saying I don't know enough about these naked shorting theories, nor do I have the proper access to information. One thing I will say, is I've seen a ton of fishy activity around the stock. But regardless, that doesn't change my perspective on owning the stock. I personally believe this entire story has been incredibly misunderstood by most investors, and clouded by a lot of nonsense on (degensub). Although, there are incredibly smart individuals sharing high-quality research on there for free, its inspiring. I encourage you to give this a read, it might give you a new perspective, if not you can just laugh at me. Lets go üëá (to the moon?) Lets start with a brief history of GameStop and how it managed to be sub $4/share during the COVID-19 market selloff. GameStop started operations in 1984, as Babbage's, a software retailer. They slowly shifted to selling more and more videogame related products before taking on the name of GameStop in 1999. Given the gaming boom that was undergoing, they showed incredible success. They went on to purchase/start various different electronic retailers and build on their GameStop brand, including MovieStop, Eb Games, Rhino video Games, Atrix etc. [https://www.gamestop.com/collection/atrix](https://www.gamestop.com/collection/atrix) They essentially were consolidating the video game retailer market, while exploring different complimentary segments, all typical moves to continue growth for a maturing industry-leader. They missed the entire point though. For GameStop to succeed, it couldn't just be a retailer. They had to become a technology company. GameStop went on to perform quite well, and turned into a dividend stock from the years 2012-2019. 2019 is when the most recent CEO, George Sherman entered the picture. George was suppose to be the savior of GameStop and lead the turn around. The majority of what George Sherman did was buyback shares, and yell omni-channel retailer pivot while slowly generating some of GameStop's revenue online - a true misuse of the world omni-channel, which has become quite the buzzword for nearly every retailer. All while digital downloads of video games were accelerating, threatening their core business model. Plus, e-commerce titans like Amazon were swallowing market share. **August 2020: Ryan Cohen enters the chat** Everyone loves to talk about (degensub) triggering the short squeeze. They might've added fuel to the fire, but this man deserves all the credit. And I do mean credit, not blame. [@ryancohen](https://twitter.com/ryancohen) Ryan is, in my eyes, an inspiration. For those of you who don't know who Ryan Cohen is, he is the founder and former CEO of Chewy .com. He sold it to PetSmart for $3.3B back in 2017. He is often referred to as ""Wall Street's Darling"".

"Why I‚Äôm Buying Rivian Stock Individual stock picking is for smart people who wear expensive suits. I‚Äôm not very smart and I hate wearing suits. I‚Äôm a boring index-fund guy. After all, history and math show us that the safe path to retirement is to simply plop money into a Vanguard fund every month. And that‚Äôs what I do with most of my money. But sometimes I see a juicy opportunity that fires me up. Occasionally, the timing of that opportunity is juuuuusst right and I put real money on the line. This is one of those situations and I'd love to hear what you think about it. I recently bought 4000 shares of Rivian stock (RIVN). My average cost is just over $16/share. That amounts to about $65,000. At the time of this writing, Rivian floats around $15.00/share and has a $14.5b market cap. I might buy another 1000 shares depending on the feedback that I get to this post. Anyway, here is why I believe Rivian will 3-4x in the next few years. # Point #1 ‚Äì Big Picture - EV‚Äôs Will Win‚Ä¶ Guaranteed. Over the next 25 years, the auto industry is going to transition to electric vehicles because they will be cheaper to buy and operate. Hear me out: 1. Right now, batteries are the most expensive part of an EV. But EV battery tech is in its infancy. Incremental advances in batteries will increase the energy density and versatility of batteries year by year. More importantly, the industry will scale battery production by a few orders of magnitude. This will make EV batteries significantly cheaper to purchase on a per unit basis. 2. Government‚Äôs will continue to incentivize EV purchases with tax credits and other incentives for decades to come. In the long run, governments are definitely going to incentivize large scale energy creation by renewable means (which is getting cheaper and cheaper). On the other hand, western Governments are not going to subsidize or incentivize more coal power plants. That is just a fact. 3. Moreover, gas cars are only going to get more expensive operate because gas is a finite resource. The world is literally running out of oil. We‚Äôve only got like 100-200 years left. So, gas prices are going to go up guaranteed. On the other hand, we ain‚Äôt gonna run out of electricity. Humans will continue to innovate and drive down the relative cost of electricity. This is inevitable. I know I‚Äôm painting with broad strokes here, but I think any rational mind will agree with most of these assertions. Stay with me. This post gets better as I go‚Ä¶ Now, just because EV‚Äôs will be less expensive than ICE vehicles in the long run doesn‚Äôt mean Rivian is going to win the game. OEM‚Äôs like Ford, GM &amp; Stellantis are starting to produce and sell EV‚Äôs‚Ä¶ right??? Won‚Äôt Ford and Toyota and others crush Rivian at the EV game? Nope‚Ä¶ not a chance. Keep reading and I‚Äôll show you why. # Point #2 ‚Äì Pure EV Makers like Rivian &amp; Telsa Will Crush Traditional Auto Manufacturers Ford, GM, and Stellantis don‚Äôt stand a chance against Tesla &amp; Rivian. Even if they start making compelling EV‚Äôs for customers, OEM‚Äôs will be at a long-term structural disadvantage to Rivian &amp; Tesla. Here is why: 1. Rivian does not have a dealership sales model. Dealerships are a useless 3rd party which customers hate. Removing the dealership permits Rivian to sell its vehicles for cheaper than it otherwise could, but also make more profit than it otherwise could. This will be a long-term structural competitive advantage over OEMs. 2. Rivian does not have unions. Unions uniquely harm the automobile industry because the cost of strikes and the cost of artificial wage increases after the strike ends increase the cost of vehicles. The 2023 UAW strike is a good example. If Rivian treats its employees with dignity and respect, they should avoid unionization. This will be a long-term competitive advantage over OEMs. 3. Rivian will make money from servicing and repairing vehicles. In the current OEM-dealership model, the dealership makes more money from the service department th",Rebel,Tesla,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/19f3fgb/why_im_buying_rivian_stock/

If anyone has any questions on the process too feel free to ask. Also apologies if this posted multiple times, Reddit was glitching out. # Story: Picked up a Brand new Model 3 LR w/ Boost on December 12th 2021. Loved the hell out of it! On March 5th, 2022, my Fiancee had a very unfortunate mishap that caused the car to veer off the road and mount a guardrail for about 3 seconds. The damage looked VERY minimal, and the photos make it look as though almost nothing is wrong. Both right-side tires fell off the wheels, and there was some bumper/undercarriage damage. My insurer quoted me at a mere 900$ for the repairs. [Site of the Accident](https://preview.redd.it/zel2859wp7691.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fca85f8f3df800da9d9c8af05962a0f3543e79b7) My main concern was if there was any damage to the battery. I called AAA and got a tow, but this is lesson #1: **KNOW THE NEAREST REPAIR CENTER CLOSEST TO YOU IN ADVANCE.** Tesla doesnt do serious repairs on their own, and I had NO idea where to take the car, so I ended up having it towed to my house for 2 days until I found a shop that could take it. I live in Maine, so it ended up being a place in MA \~170 miles from me. https://preview.redd.it/5d7wz4pyp7691.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78fea7f7944d1ba3717348f8c997361637026772 https://preview.redd.it/uwtgw6pyp7691.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=779ed81737eb350aad3d4c547286140af53247e0 &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; **Long Story Short:** The guardrail sliced the battery like a sword and caused damage. Since the body of the car is in perfect condition, its salvage value was very high and my insurer (Geico) and the shop decided it was easiest to Total it rather than wait 6+ months for a Battery from Tesla. I paid 52k brand new for it, plus 2K for the boost, and after several price increases during my ownership and tax rebates, Geico settled for 69K!! So all-in I was net-positive by about 12k during my 3 months of ownership, which is crazy. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Immediately turned that 12K into a downpayment on a brand spankin' new MS Plaid, which I took delivery of on June 7th. Original Order Estimate was '4 weeks' when I placed it on March 12th. https://preview.redd.it/61tkdc02q7691.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a65176bc27b371f8ee5bbf6777e571e9f616a114 Words cannot describe how amazing the Plaid is.

The Tow Hook is Lefty-Tighty Righty-Loosey for some reason 4. I was quoted at only 8k to replace the battery of the Model 3. This is a huge deal for long-term ownership.

"My personal testament to the concept, ""value is subjective"". (Giant f*cking story alert) WARNING - LOTS OF TEXT TO FOLLOW PART I - Excitement I drove the same car from 16 years old to the day I got hired at my first ""real"" job out of college. It was a 2001 Subaru Outback. The thing was awesome. It carried all of my high school friends on countless adventures, made several expeditions through terrible weather conditions across the mountain passes of Western Washington, and stayed on the road with very few mechanical issues despite my sometimes less-than-pampering treatment. As reliable as it was, an older used Outback wasn't the coolest car to have as a 16, 18, or 22 year old. This was always in the back of my head. I wouldn't say I felt embarrassed driving it, but it just wasn't something I took pride in when I was driving down the road. So throughout college, I told myself that I would save as much as I could. When I graduated and found a career job, I would spend whatever I was able to save on a new, COOLER, car. I worked every summer, odds and ends of jobs; one year as a camp counselor, one year a marketing intern. I vicously saved all of my summer money that I could throughout the school year. I was fortunate to have parents that covered my basic amenities in college (cheap rented house shared with 4 people, a basic meal plan at the school, stuff like that), so I didn't have to worry about large monthly expenses. I even avoided ""necessity"" purchases like a mattress, instead opting to sleep on a $30 inflatable one. All in the name of saving for a cool car. I graduate college and find a good job at the end of 2012. By this time, I had saved up about $8,000 in my ""car fund"". About 4 months after moving to my current town for work, I come into contact with a higher-up at Microsoft selling his 2005 Audi A6 because he is buying a Tesla. It was top of the line, fully-loaded. 4.2 liter V8, 335hp - the thing was crazy. He was the only owner, bought it new in '05, had all the service records, and was only selling it to clear out the room in his garage. 92,000 miles. He found a dealer that was giving him $12,000 for it. I asked him if I was able to match that offer, would he instead sell to me. He agreed. I proceeded to ask my dad if I could borrow $4,000 from him to cover the difference I needed. Now having a salaried position, I knew I could make car payments relatively easy, I just knew trying to finance this 7 year-old car through a bank as a first-time borrower would be more difficult. He loaned me the money. I was stoked! I had the coolest (and fastest) car of all of my friends. Even though it was 7 years old, it looked new. It had been super well maintained, this guy had just finished performing ""tune-up"" maintenance to sell it, so it had new brakes, new tires, oil was changed, cabin filter, etc etc. Part II - Enlightenment Fast forward about 4 months. Still loving the car. I'm noticing it's kind of expensive to fill up, though, with gas prices being where they were at, and the fact that this thing isn't that fuel efficient (20 - 24 mpg). I'm spending almost $80 to fill the tank up sometimes, but whatever. At this point it's about time for this Audi's first oil change. Wow, $150 for an oil change. Oh, it takes 8 or 9 quarts of oil? And HAS to have the oil that's $10/quart? Yikes. The price I pay for a sweet car I guess! Let's jump ahead another 4 or 5 months. I notice a very deflated tire coming back to my Audi in the parking lot of a restaurant. I baby my way to a local tire shop. Don't exactly remember why the tire couldn't be fixed, but I remember that I had to buy new tires. It's a quattro, so I can't just replace two of them, it needs all four replaced. Oh this Audi takes super wide, weird-sized tires? Ok, how much are those? $900? Holy &amp;%*#. Ok, well get it done I guess. Now the fun starts.

"My story of Porsches, dealers, greed, and betrayal. There have been several posts over the past few months on this forum where folks are considering a new 911 or upgrade their existing one. It has inspired me to share my story. It is a long one but trust me it has a happy ending! Last year, I was in a similar situation and looking for an upgrade. I had a 991.1 C4S that I bought new in 2015. I never thought about reselling it and drove it everywhere. The car was the opposite of ‚Äúgarage queen‚Äù. As it happens with all toys, I started craving a potential upgrade around late 2021, early 2022. Honestly, I was so happy with my 911, I wasn‚Äôt even thinking about other options. I just wanted a better 911. My requirements hadn‚Äôt changed since I last bought the car, I don‚Äôt track it, I have a young kid (so 2+2 was a must), my wife occasionally drove the car (so no stick) and I‚Äôm personally not into over the top design e.g. the wing. So, long story short, a 718 or GT3/RS were never on my shortlist. My list started and ended with a 992 Turbo S. Early in 2022, I went to the multiple dealers near me and asked about allocations for a new Turbo S and I was told there is a waiting list for about 8-10 months. It was right after Covid, manufacturing is impacted so I said ‚Äúfair enough‚Äù and put finally my name around with a dealer around early-mid 2022 for a Turbo S allocation. Mind you, I am an existing owner, so I didn‚Äôt think too much about being treated as someone who wasn‚Äôt serious. The spec I configured was a decent one with almost $30k in options for a total of ~$260k MSRP. No other conversation was had, no other kind of payment was brought up. Dealer even told me that I‚Äôd be getting some fancy watch to go with my new car! Few months go by, crickets. Towards the end of the 2022, I emailed the dealer asking for an update. She said ‚Äúnothing yet, we‚Äôre still behind blah blah‚Äù. I said ok, will keep waiting - not like I‚Äôm stuck driving M3 or *shudder* a Tesla ;). Beginning of 2023 was busy for me with work travel so I kind of forgot about the car. I reached out to the dealer in April. This time I was a bit upset. It had been months and there was nothing from them, no communication, no acknowledgment, nothing. This is when she brings up ‚Äúmarket adjustment‚Äù of $25k. I was pissed. I wasn‚Äôt going to get in front of another queue for at least another few months. I wasn‚Äôt even in the market for the ‚Äúhot‚Äù GT3/RS that almost everyone else was (and still is) buying to flip. I wanted a genuine upgrade to my daily driver that I would have happily kept and driven for the next decade. I was so happy with my 911 that I wasn‚Äôt even thinking about anything else. [Soapbox] To the ‚ÄúGt3-is-my-daily-driver‚Äù crowd, please be honest with yourself. DM me in a year when your back and ass are constantly hurting daily driving a car with suspension made out of rock. To the genuinely small number of people who plan to keep the car for track days and use the car for what‚Äôs it good for, you have my respect.[/Soapbox] This is when things changed for me. I started thinking logically. Simple math, if I am paying almost $300k with taxes and registration, I now have other options on the table. This is also when I started to really focus on what I wanted from a car and came to the, now obvious, conclusion that what I really I wanted was a sporty grand tourer that was at least a 2+2 and automatic (to drive the kid around for a few more years and keep the wife happy). With my newfound freedom of choice, I started to look at other options, outside of 911s. There were three legitimate contenders and a secret one - 1. a Continental GT (easier to get, comfortable like no other car I‚Äôve ever been in but a bit too Septuagenarian looks for my taste), 2. a DB11 (very easy to get, lot more sportier, much better looking but outdated interior that felt too cramped for a 2+2), 3. a Roma (drop dead gorgeous, extremely sporty drive and relatively comfortable with air suspension optioned but pain in",Rebel,Tesla,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Porsche/comments/19bf6nk/my_story_of_porsches_dealers_greed_and_betrayal/

Hyliion is a company that develops and sells electric powertrain systems for transport trucks involved in long-distance trucking. Their drivetrain -- the Hypertruck ERX -- is fueled by compressed natural gas (CNG) and/or renewable natural gas (RNG), which are MUCH more green than diesel, which is used by most trucking companies. RNG can even achieve **negative emissions**. You know when you turn loose an earth-shaking fart in a very public setting, and you just wish you could suck that noxious gas back up inside you to avoid further humiliation from that flower-wilting smell? Well, this is almost identical to that. Kind of. I know what you're thinking: *""So what? This dinosaur can un-fart gas. Aren't we moving away from gas and towards fully electric, hydrogen-powered, and nuclear fusion-powered vehicles anyway?""* There's a few things to keep in mind: * Stuff needs to get shipped TODAY * There **aren't** enough plug-in refueling stations for **transport trucks** in the US * There **aren't** enough hydrogen refueling stations in the US (only 39 currently) * There **are** currently enough CNG and RNG refueling stations for the trucking industry * CNG/RNG is currently 1/12 the price of hydrogen and 1/7 the price of electric refueling * In the future, CNG/RNG will be 1/3 the price of hydrogen, and 1/2 the price of electric refueling * HYLN's powertrain is designed specifically to be able to be used with hydrogen in the future, anyway * Trucking companies aren't going to want to wait around [30 minutes](https://www.businessinsider.com/this-expert-says-tesla-semi-is-economically-and-ecologically-pointless-2019-2) for their trucks to get an 80% charge every [500 miles](https://www.autoweek.com/news/green-cars/a34774933/musk-now-says-621-miles-of-range-for-tesla-semi/) (source: latest max range \* 80%) using a theoretical megacharger station which [doesn't even exist](https://www.torquenews.com/11663/tesla-looking-develop-so-called-megachargers-tesla-semi-trucks) currently, and also lose 1 ton in carrying capacity due to the weight of the battery Source: [https://i.ibb.co/WpQy5NL/hylnfuel.png](https://i.ibb.co/WpQy5NL/hylnfuel.png) HYLN's powertrain also offers other advantages: * Increases efficiency and reduces cost of gas for truckers by up to 35% (one of the biggest costs for trucking companies) * Drastically increases pulling power up hills (time is money, dongus) * Software uses machine learning that optimizes driving patterns, introducing further savings * Eliminates need for idling vehicle when truckers are staying overnight in the cabin with a couple of ""friends of the road"" I can hear you now: ""*But ",Rebel,Tesla,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mqrfzf/hyln_how_we_got_here_where_were_going_aka_the_moon/
"Yet another Tesla trade in nightmare **EDIT 08-13-2024 14:57 EST** Tesla rep called me earlier today to discuss my questions including the trade issue. Joshua was friendly, articulate and seemed to know what was up. He couldnt't figure out what happened with the trade, so he suggested I re-enter the trade info and he'd watch it on his end. I do as requested and the trade value is now higher than the original offer and the app requested more info including a pic of the odometer and title front and back. Offer was given and now it says the trade offer is good until September 12. Financing options all updated to reflect the new trade offer so I accepted all that and we seem to be good to go. Car is supposed to hit the delivery location on 08-19-2024. Let's see what happens now. **EDIT 08-11-2024 06:00 PM EST** Tesla replied (via the app) to my question about why the trade value dropped 60% and said they don't see a trade associated with this purchase and would I like to continue with the purchase, lol. They don't even see the trade they lowballed me on. Wow. :P I'm posting this for anyone searching to learn more about the Tesla trade process. My experience is just a data point for you to consider and added to the other trade in stories. I'm dealing with the Mt. Kisco Tesla delivery center (I think...all comms are with faceless texts so far and one phone rep who couldn't find the car I wanted that was listed right in Tesla inventory while we were on the phone) Tesla offers me $19K for a 21 Prius Prime Limited. Yes, well under wholesale based on other offers from dealers and online buyers, but with the tax break when trading in NY it's close enough. I wouldn't have to rent a car to go pick up the MYP so that saves me some money and time. We get closer to the delivery date and I get a message that Tesla has updated my offer information. Open the app and they've lowered the trade offer to $11,400. wtf? That's about half of average wholesale. They didn't request any photos of the car (which is pristine, non smoker, new tires) so it's confusing what caused this. These cars are very popular and incredibly reliable so... If Tesla doesn't want my trade, just tell me up front. It would have saved me nearly 10 days of planning how I'll pick up the new car. Now, I'm scrambling to figure out what I'll do with the trade. If I bail on the deal I lose $250, plus the $250 for the charger they've already shipped me (since they don't include an EVSE with a $60K car). So far, dealing with Tesla has been the weirdest and least upfront car purchase I've experienced and I've bought almost 50 cars in my lifetime (new and used). The lack of communication, getting ghosted once the order was placed and having the trade price dropped by 60% really hasn't created any good feelings towards the brand. I know others have had a different experience, but that doesn't negate mine.

"Ford vs Ferrari Part 1 - Greasing the Wheels *From the guys who brought you [The Greatest Short Burn of the Century](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ip6jnv/the_real_greatest_short_burn_of_the_century/)..* &gt; *Oh man, oh man, oh man.* &gt; *Not again.* &gt; -Drizzy **Preface:** Please believe me when I say I really wanted to take this month off and enjoy the snow in Tahoe. But as I was driving, something caught my eye... Make no mistake. This stock is not going to be nearly as volatile or profitable as GME. In fact, this might be so boring that most of you will ignore me yet again. **And that‚Äôs exactly why I like it.** I‚Äôll do my best to make this engaging, but the fact is, this is going to be a slow grind. Both this DD and the stock. Also, as a bonus, Reddit is currently public enemy #1 in the eyes of the media. Why don‚Äôt we do a quick heel-turn and join their side? Are they gonna hate us for buying boring value stocks? They won‚Äôt know what hit them. That will be a fun show to watch. Anyway‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs take a look under the hood. **As always, not financial advice. Just education. NOTHING IS A RECOMMENDATION. We are just sharing knowledge here. Ok SEC?** **Intro:** Ford (NYSE: $F -- NOT NASDAQ:$FORD), is another depressed deep value multiple expansion arbitrage play. No short squeeze this time. The GME asymmetry may not be seen again for 10 years. It might seem boring and unsexy on the surface, but Ford is a fantastic company in the midst of one of the best turnarounds in American history. And with a little help from our friend Mr. Options (or as Buffett called, Financial Weapons of Mass Destruction) we can turn a boring old Ford into a lightning fast Ferrari using the quadruple income option wheel strategy. Don‚Äôt try this at home. If you don‚Äôt know what CSPs, CCs, or vega are, stick to shares. Those should work just fine. Let‚Äôs break this down into 5 parts: electrification story and leadership, multiples expansion, technical analysis, options, and the trade. By the way, in 2019, the Ford F-Series was second only to the Apple iPhone, which raked in $55 billion, in terms of total revenue generated. The F-Series generated more revenue than the NFL, MLB, NBA, and the NHL combined, which added up to $40 billion. Just something to think about. &gt; The wheels on the bus go round and round, round and round... **Electrification story and leadership:** Let‚Äôs jump into history for a second. Ford had a meteoric rise from 1997 - 1999 from $15 to around $32 at the peak. This was due to $F reporting massive earnings increases each quarter: * [Dec 1996 - 1997 Ford F-150 - Truck of the Year](https://www.motortrend.com/news/1997-ford-f150-truck-of-the-year/) * [Jan 1997 - Ford profits up 82 percent](https://money.cnn.com/1997/01/29/companies/ford/) * [Oct 1997 - Ford profits up 64 percent](https://www.spokesman.com/stories/1997/oct/16/ford-earnings-surge-64/) * [Jan 1998 - Ford profits up 56 percent](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1998-jan-28-fi-12792-story.html) They were just feasting and feasting. Jim Farley looks like the best person alive to revitalize Ford, capable of tripling the stock in 2-3 years. Look at the last two quarters: * Q3-2020 - Adjusted EPS: 65 cents vs 19 cents expected, Automotive revenue: $34.71 billion vs $33.51 billion expected (due to pent up demand) * Q2-2020 - Adjusted EPS: A loss of 35 cents per share versus a loss of $1.17 per share expected, Automotive revenue: $16.6 billion versus $15.95 billion expected. Here are excerpts from the Q3 earnings and some other notable highlights: &gt; Farley: Now that plan, which was introduced to the Ford team and many stakeholders on October 1, is very straightforward.

"Tesla Hidey Hole (Richmond, VA)- Don't believe the numbers tomorrow but the ERDF is real. Before I jump into the stock related stuff, as an old, I feel it is important to preface this with a little cautionary advice. Here is my three points of ""don't be stupid"": 1. I know Richmond has a storied history of burning shit going all the way back to the Civil War- but don't burn any Teslas. It's not worth it. And it's stupid. Furthermore, you are putting first responders at risk. You will also likely get caught. At least here in Virginia, there are [cameras everywhere](https://cardinalnews.org/2025/03/28/i-drove-300-miles-in-rural-virginia-then-asked-police-to-send-me-their-public-surveillance-footage-of-my-car-heres-what-i-learned/) and Tesla's themselves will record you. It's just not worth throwing your life away no matter how mad you might be. Before you get labeled a domestic terrorist and thrown in an El Salvadorian prison, read some Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and get some perspective. He wrote from a Russian gulag after sharing his negative opinion of Stalin. We are currently on Reddit and nobody is going to jail for it. 2. Don't harass individual Tesla owners. They didn't do anything to deserve it and most likely hate what is happening as well. I know some of them. It is unreasonable to ask them to dump their daily driver at a huge loss because Elon decided to make himself into a human lighting rod. 3. I deliberately waited for the ""Tesla Takedown"" to be over before making this post so nobody would get any bright ideas. What you think is making a difference is likely to have the opposite effect from what you are hoping for. The people trying to stick it to Trump just got him more [support from billionaires](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckvvlv3lewxo) after he was convicted and if you didn't notice, $TSLA started deep in the red yesterday after the Tesla Takedown over the weekend and rallied way back and finished considerably up today. None of that moved the needle in any direction but up. Furthermore, if you burn or vandalize a Tesla, the insurance company will pay for it and just jack up all of our rates in turn. If any destroyed cars are still owned by Tesla, they will just use accounting methods to write it off. And that is one less car they don't have to sell at a time when they aren't selling many, which is the ultimate point of this post and makes a nice segue. If you are mad about what Elon Musk is doing, or just want to make money on your $TSLA puts (like me- position disclosed), what sends a stronger message? A few burnt up Teslas or entire parking lots full of them because nobody wants to buy them? In my opinion, as well as [others with puts](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/nick-denton-interview-thiel-musk) on Tesla and think Elon has lost it, it is the latter. Speaking of which... I found one such parking lot! First, check out the few pictures I took of the local Tesla dealership here in Richmond (just outside the city). Their lot is clearly over capacity but nothing jaw dropping. There are a few dozen vehicles on the street and in a neighboring parking lot. After I shared these with a few friends, one of them told me that there were vehicle transporters unloading new Teslas near his work, which is a few miles away from the dealership and in an area of office buildings that have nothing to do with Tesla. I checked it out and there are a lot of them stuffed in the back of the lot. It's hard to see because I took the pictures at night and the cars are spread out but there are easily over 20 Cybertrucks and probably somewhere near 50 vehicles in total.

"First 24hrs with my Model Y Performance (spoiler: full motor failure) **Backstory** I've always been into cars, and I was looking to get a new vehicle as my winter/practical car. I'm keeping my S4 and 718 Cayman S as well, so this was going to be in addition to those 2. I've been in enough Audi/BMW/Mercs/Porsches and wanted something different. Smooth power, roomy interior, cool factor and quiet ride were my main considerations. I don't need the all out performance of something like an X3M or GLC63 since I've got other cars. I wanted this to be a stark contrast to my current 2 vehicles. &amp;nbsp; Decided a MYP would be a good fit, especially with very strong resale value. I can keep it for a few years and see what the electric market is like with Rivian, electric Macan etc. The ordering and delivery process was terrible, but that's another story. It was easily the worst ""dealership"" experience I've had buying any car (new or used). &amp;nbsp; Anyways, I get my car on the evening of Dec 10th. By the afternoon of the 11th, it had a rear motor failure followed by a completely dead vehicle that's unable to drive. &amp;nbsp; **Motor Failure** Picked up my blue on white MYP on the evening of Dec 10th. By the afternoon of the 11th, it had a [rear motor failure](https://imgur.com/FqTE42h) and 2 mins later was [completely undriveable](https://imgur.com/2NQjz3W) and had to be towed to the dealer. It was being driven at 60km/h when a warning came up about the rear motor. A couple mins later, it was fully dead. Luckily I was near a friends house and parked it in their driveway. Would have sucked if this happened on the highway. I googled the error and it seems like this has happened to other people before, and usually pretty soon after delivery. Still, off too a pretty terrible start with the car. &amp;nbsp; Bad things I've noticed over the first 24hrs, coming from someone who's into cars and driven a bunch of stuff on street/track: &amp;nbsp; **Build Quality:** Wasn't expecting much here, so I was ok with some gaps and not having perfect panels. There was some glue residue on the edges of the panoramic roof, and there were marks on the headliner when I took delivery. The interior plastic piece on the b pillar has a massive gap between it and the roof on 1 side. Otherwise, I'm totally ok with it. I knew what I was getting into and wasn't expecting it to be on the level of the germans. &amp;nbsp; **Closing the Door:** You have to pull pretty hard to actually close the door. It wasn't just me either. Multiple people failed to close the door properly the first time they tried. You really have to slam it more than any other car I've owned. Not a very nice experience for the user. I can imagine some older person actually having trouble to close it properly. &amp;nbsp; **Honk Upon Lock:** I can't believe this car makes a cheap honk sound when you lock it like some early 2000s GM car. It should 100% have some pleasant sounding chip/beep. &amp;nbsp; **Loud Seat Motors:** Loudest seat motors I've heard, especially the lumbar. &amp;nbsp; **Cheap Carpet Mats:** I've already installed proper mats, but the stock carpet mats (only included for driver and passenger) are the thinnest and cheapest feeling carpet mats I've experienced. They're so lightweight and flimsy with no impression of quality. This doesn't matter too much, but it speaks to the cost cutting happening everywhere. &amp;nbsp; **Can't View Songs on Phone?** Unless I'm dumb, is there actually no way to view a list of all music on my iPhone and pick something? The interface between phone and the car is terrible and super limited. I really hope I'm missing something here. There isn't even an easy way to activate Siri since the in-car voice button will trigger the Tesla voice assistant.

In honor of Summer Solstice for the northern hemisphere, I've made an updated list of popular lights. Today is the day you're least likely to need a flashlight north of the equator. Every day after for the next six months increases the probability, so now is the perfect time to get one[.](http://zakreviews.com/static/photos/fw3a/derivatives/article-image/DSC_0500(1\).JPG) Because a definitive buyer's guide is too hard, I've made an arbitrary list of popular lights you should consider if you're shopping for a light. There is no best flashlight, so this is not the last word in what's good, but a list of lights that are often bought or recommended here with a touch of my own opinion thrown in. Exclusion from this list doesn't mean a light isn't good. To search more lights by their attributes, try http://flashlights.parametrek.com/index.html Briefly, here are some characteristics that are usually considered desirable. Most of the recommended lights won't have all of them, but these are things to look for when shopping for lights: * Neutral white tint - the [vast majority](https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/5yjqcr/poll_preferred_color_temperature/) of people with an opinion prefer a color temperature that's within the range of direct sunlight, which is generally marketed as ""neutral white"", but sometimes as ""warm white"" * A lack of red, or especially green off-tints, beam artifacts and tint shift from the center of the beam to the edges * A user interface that does not require cycling through different modes to turn off, and does not change modes every time the light is turned off * A lack of blinking modes within the standard mode rotation, either because the light doesn't have any, or they're ""hidden"" by being accessed in a different manner than the usual modes * An IP waterproofing rating - most good lights are rated for IPX8 with the depth and duration of submersion specified by the manufacturer * A lack of timed stepdowns. Some lights only produce their maximum output for a few minutes at a time. While some powerful lights can get too hot to hold if run on high constantly, the hardware necessary to measure temperature and only reduce power if the light is actually too hot costs only a few cents, but many lights won't overheat badly anyway * Full-spectrum, or high-CRI for more accurate color rendering. Color rendering index, or CRI is the most common measurement of this; average LEDs are about 70. Over 80 is decent, and over 90 is excellent. The highest I've heard of from an LED is [99](http://budgetlightforum.com/node/60236). This is more important for seeing detail than absolute output and can be the difference between a stick and a snake on the trail. * A sub-lumen moonlight mode (for general-use lights) * A user interface that allows access to the lowest and highest modes from off without having to cycle through other modes * A user interface where a single click turns the light on in a reasonable mode, and another single click turns it off. # About specs Lumens are total output. Don't worry about small differences in output. You probably can't detect a 10% difference in lumens with your eyes, and 20% is barely noticeable. It takes 4 times the lumens to look twice as bright. Candela is intensity, which translates to throw distance. FL1 throw numbers are about right for detecting large objects; cut them in half for seeing clearly. Extreme throw distances also run in to limits imposed by human vision and by backscatter in the atmosphere. Warmer tints have less backscatter. FL1 runtime numbers are to 10% output and can be misleading. Look for a review with a runtime graph. Performance specs for AA and AAA powered lights are usually given with NiMH rechargeable batteries.

""* and the like ""argue"" without ever substantiating this classification. Main thing to create a (negative) mood to get others to sell. Same in the opposite direction. There is daily speculation about takeovers or attempts to bring about a short squeeze based on certain percentages that a stock is sold short. Both are wrong in the first place. Hardly any investors still invest in products and companies, many are only ""gamblers"". At the same time, these players put products, companies and jobs at risk. For example, a good product cannot be developed and sold overnight. Nevertheless, these gamblers expect results in days or weeks and months at the most, and if they don't come immediately, this is made out to be a problem. Even though everything within the company is on schedule. Even the development of an iPhone takes a year or more. More and more often you can read, especially with new products or companies, that the company has not made any sales or profits yet. How could it, if the product is still in development? If that still doesn't work, the killer argument will eventually be used. Competitor XYZ is already on the market and sells more. Or already has many partners. This was also the argument regarding Apple when Nokia was still the world market leader for mobile phones and smartphones and Apple presented the first iPhone. The outcome is well known. Or with Tesla vis-√†-vis the established car manufacturers. Today, a Tesla drives away even a Porsche and Tesla is constantly building new factories. Porsche, on the other hand, is also doing well, but cannot keep up with Tesla's expansion and is technically (e.g. in terms of range) lagging behind. What all of this has in common is that you can't extrapolate from the past to the future. Otherwise, there would never be new market leaders. The future of a company lies in its current and future- oriented products, not in its old ones. There are, of course, exceptions to the rule, such as food manufacturers, like Coca-Cola, or banks, etc. Here, however, it should be about technical products and their manufacturers. **Summary: Ultimately, only the business outlook determines the future of a company and thus the share price. The business outlook depends on the current and future products.** That is why short sales figures etc. are not considered here. Instead,it will be shown **why there is currently only one company in the field of lidar sensors that meets all the requirements of large car manufacturers** such as Volkswagen, Toyota, etc. and where **a short squeeze could be triggered shortly due to their technical superiority**, since this technological superiority cannot be explained away or ""sold short"". **It should likely cause price reactions when a company is valued at only about 1/3 the market cap of inferior competitors on the stock market, as** **Microvision** **currently is relative to** [**Luminar.**](https://www.luminartech.com/) Both companies in September 2021 at the world's largest motor show IAA in Munich: https://preview.redd.it/ohvcmi2v9vs71.png?width=1378&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6df79bd47d043efb1f2fb2810649e65becd691e0 Sources: private Because in the field of lidar for self-driving cars (levels 3-5), the current ""official"" market leader is Luminar.

"$TSLA Bullish price is 287USD (DD) No emotions, minimum speculations, just raw impartial numbers. We will answer once and for all what is the fair value of TSLA. &amp;#x200B; **Chapter 1. Bull thesis (and other lies I tell myself?)** &amp;#x200B; Let's start with the typical bull thesis. The one you have probably encountered many times in the wilderness of reddit or twitter. It goes like this: &amp;#x200B; * Tesla's car sales will grow 50% annually for foreseeable future. Eventually reaching annual production rate of 20M by 2030. Source: [Technoking himself](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1310486616075579393) &amp;#x200B; * Net margins will stay as high or even grow further from the latest 13.1% (Q4 2021). Commonly cited reasons are 4680, Gigacasting... maybe even Alien Dreadnought? &amp;#x200B; * Tesla is a tech company. They will generate tons of revenue by selling software such as ~~Fraud~~ Full-Self-Driving, and might eventually launch their own marketplace (see AppStore). &amp;#x200B; * Tesla is... *ETF**?* (cannot add a link to youtube video, but it is from solving the money problem) &amp;#x200B; * Tesla ~~sex~~bot. Enough said. &amp;#x200B; Let's start with an automotive sales part: &amp;#x200B; * Say Tesla is such Gigachad^(TM) that it reaches 20M sales without reducing the prices or introducing the cheaper model(s). According to Q4 2021 Financial Report, current **ASP is $50.7K**, derived as auto revenue excl. regulatory credits divided by the number of delivered cars. Assuming 3% average inflation for the next 9 years (incl. current spike) the ASP in 2030 would be **$66.2K** (50.7 x 1.03\^9) &amp;#x200B; * With **net margins of 13%** that would result in **66.2K x 20M x 0.13 = $172B net income**. &amp;#x200B; * Eventually growth by 2030 will taper and converge to automotive industry average. As of writing, PEs of auto peers: Toyota - 9.64, Volkswagen - 6.88, Ford - 10.10, GM - 7.10, BMW - 4.75. But Tesla being Tesla, so we award an automotive **Tesla PE of 15**. &amp;#x200B; * Tesla market cap by end 2030 is (drum roll...) **172B x 15 = 2.58T**. An absolute automotive leader with 20M sales at an average price of 66.2K USD, with outstanding operating margins (\~twice the industry average), with PE 15 (approximately twice the industry average) will triple from the current valuation (or double from January 3's)? &amp;#x200B; * Taking an average of 7% market growth leads to Net Present Value (NPV) of 2.58T / 1.07\^9 = **1.4T\*,** so *...* Tesla on January 3rd was pretty fairly valued? Although why would anyone invest in a single stock for a 7% growth versus investing into SPY? &amp;#x200B; * From the other angle, if you invest in TSLA now (market cap of 890B as of writing) it will return you (2.58 / 0.89)\^(1/9) = 1.125 or **12.5% annually**. Not too shabby, but also anything but impressive in contrast to its growth in the last two years. &amp;#x200B; But careful observer would remind me that we are talking about *Tech* company and not an *Auto* company. But before we go there... let's discuss what is wrong with the bull thesis above. &amp;#x200B; **Chapter 2. Automotive market.** &amp;#x200B; Many analyses that I have read address future volumes only from the perspective of the supply. Analyses argue that the ramp up of the existing factories plus the introduction of new ones can support 50% growth, eventually reaching 20M car sales by 2030. What they often fail to address is the total addressable market (TAM), which is in our case the EV market in 2030. To be clear, below we will include both plug-in hybrids (PHEV) and battery electric vehicles (BEV) as parts of the EV market. The main reasoning is that for a wide target audience PHEV covers 95% of all use-cases (daily trips within a city) with electric power, therefore creates a real alternative to buying BEV (what happened to me and my wife personally). &amp;#x200B; No doubt the EV market will be enormous by 2030.

"Squeeze? Squoze? Maybe it is just good ole fashion deep value. A Wall Street Betters Guide To Reinventing A Legacy Brand. First and foremost Diamond Hands... if you are already here and wont starve why not? For many of us whether we made 100k or were left with $10 we were going to take the proceeds to buy a slice of pizza and a beer. So hold.... you don't know what happens next. That is the beauty of speculative investing. The good news is neither do the hedge funds. Here are a few things to keep in mind. Feel free to add or discuss. Maybe someone of meaningful repute will take a fancy. &amp;#x200B; 1. You can only look at this as a loss if you are a paperhand. If you are holding look at this nebulous ""loss"" as an investment in market transparency that could potentially pay dividends for retail investors down the road. You don't know whether or not what has occurred here could potentially tip the scale in your favor at a later date in your investment career. 2. Neither you nor any hedge funds know that these companies are toast. Yes by any traditional metric they could make an argument for it. This WSB experience has fundamentally changed their thesis whether they realize it or not. That is the exact reason you should hold. That and basically because the number one rule of investing is never lose money. 3. Valuing GME or AMC prior to WSB is a valuation of a completely different brand/company. We have created 3 things that are priceless. ORGANIC ENTHUSIASM, RIDICULOUS BRAND LOYALTY, AND UNDENIABLE BUZZ. People build multimillion dollar corporations with the intent of accomplishing this task for others. You can try to buy what we have created for these companies but it just isn't the same (like making a wendys frosty at home). These brands now own something more which could be more valuable than their original business model. Everyone loves a story. It's only a matter of time before a team is compiled to leverage this secret sauce and boot strap the next phase of the business lifecycle. 4. Given the lower valuation and the intrinsic/intangible value of these brands they could absolutely pull off one hell of a pivot or be the target of an acquisition. I'm spitballing ideas and I've seen some thrown around about Tesla buying gamestop. They could perhaps be used to rapidly roll out hundreds of testdrive centers across the country. Or perhaps they are purchased by Rockstar or EA. Maybe even Sony or Nintendo steps in and creates a direct to consumer experience. If not what if it just remained a brick and mortar retailer with a different tint. People act like brick and mortar is dead, but nobody wrote off Five Below stock. FIVE has totally crushed it this year! Who is to say it couldn't inhabit this strange space as a meme store with $5 items inspired by the internet. That is to say unless they don't end up using this buzz to get some heavy hitters on board and build the ultimate gaming/fintech cloud. People waited in line at Gamestop pre pandemic and with this much enthusiasm behind the name they may do it again. They will for damn sure wait in line at the movies again! I think we need to reenvision the theater experience. Imagine people taking self driving vehicles to the theater to drink beer and watch live sporting events while placing bets on their smartphones as the theater partners with Draftkings or Penn National. Who is to say Disney doesn't just say I'll take it. They could convert every theater into a Disney + experience in hundreds of towns across the nation! Disney is the experience brand, they could bring theaters to life in a way that nobody could even imagine. Characters, costumes, decorum, and live events. If I could take my daughters to watch and meet Bluey at our own little piece of Disney World right here in town I would do it in a heartbeat. Literally millions of other parents would also, even if it was the same content we already streamed at home.

"Ultimate Guide to why you should buy Gamestop now This is not financial advice, do your own research. I have been criticizing myself for not writing this sooner and better, and time is running out for me to do it, so here goes. I don't want to be accused of not trying, to hear ""why didn't you tell me"". Below is my reasoning why in my opinion you should buy Gamestop stock, ticker GME, broken up into the following sections: TL;DR My Story Short Squeeze Thesis Natural Growth Thesis If you have more questions, a good starting point is the top 2 stickied posts in R/Superstonk https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/ As for how to buy, it is pretty easy to open a Fidelity account, connect it to your checking account, and transfer the funds over. You should get on that. Too Long; Didn't Read (TL;DR): First, if this is all new to you, there is a year and a half of information you've missed that I do not have the time to write up and you do not have the time to read because it would take you days. This is my attempt to throw a rope of financial freedom to as many people as possible. I'm telling you that spending $130ish now could make you wealthy enough to completely change the rest of your life and your children's lives. If you don't take the rope, it's on you, I tried. Second, if you think you missed the boat, if you think ""what good is 1 or even 10 shares going to do me"", just know that if the short thesis is true, if Gamestop is still shorted over 140% and possibly over 1000%, then 1 share could be worth millions if you hold onto it. Third, forget what Gamestop was, the little game store in dying malls. Look at what it is now, a tech company led by Chairman of the Board Ryan Cohen and a team of executives who left phenomenal careers with companies like Amazon and Wal-Mart to work there. As just one example of its pivot, Gamestop will be releasing an NFT marketplace soon with the intent of revolutionizing the digital marketplace. Think of Gamestop like Microsoft, Apple, Amazon or Google during their startup phase but instead of starting with nothing they are starting out with thousands of stores and infrastructure and brand recognition and loyal customers. Everyone always says they wish they had bought lots of shares of Microsoft, Apple, or Amazon back when you first could and held them through stock splits. This is your chance to say ""I bought"" instead of ""I wish I'd bought. Gamestop is still insanely shorted (estimates over 1000%), and Gamestop is issuing a 4-1 share dividend as stock split on 7/21/22 which means if you buy a GME share by 7/21 (to be safe try to get one by 7/18) you will have 4 shares after the split, and because this is a dividend as a split and not a simple stock split, this may cause the short squeeze and this may be your last chance to buy before the price becomes unaffordable. So in my opinion you should buy at least 1 share this week. And if $130/share is too expensive for you, then after the split you should buy at least 1 share at the post-split price whatever it is, if you still can. And in my opinion you should buy as much as you can afford. I have over 1200 shares which are about to become over 4800. Just know that if you buy, you need to hold tight and be prepared to see the price drop. I originally bought in at $100/share, and saw the price rise to $483, then down to $38, and then up and down everywhere in-between since. The price will be whatever short sellers want it to be until they cannot short it any longer so buckle up. And if this split does not launch the short squeeze, just know that investors have already Direct Registered over 15 million shares of Gamestop with Gamestop's transfer agent Computershare, and eventually investors will Direct Register every single GME share with Computershare and prove the naked shorting of Gamestop. If 61 million more people just bought 1 share and DRS'ed it with Computershare right away such that all 76 million shares were direct registered, the truth would be evi",Rebel,Tesla,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/vwiy5g/ultimate_guide_to_why_you_should_buy_gamestop_now/

The RTX 3090 is the flagship gaming card that can also run intensive creative apps very well, especially by virtue of its huge 24GB framebuffer. But it is still not an RTX TITAN nor a Quadro. These cards cost a lot more and are optimized specifically for workstations and also for professional and creative apps. &gt; &gt;However, for RTX 2080 Ti gamers who paid $1199 and who have disposable cash for their hobby ‚Äì although it has been eclipsed by the RTX 3080 ‚Äì the RTX 3090 Founders Edition which costs $1500 is *the* card to maximize their upgrade. And for high-end gamers who also use creative apps, this card may become a very good value. Hobbies are very expensive to maintain, and the expense of PC gaming pales in comparison to what golfers, skiers, audiophiles, and many other hobbyists pay for their entertainment. But for high-end gamers on a budget, the $699 RTX 3080 will provide the most value of the two cards. We cannot call the $1500 RTX 3090 a ‚Äúgood value‚Äù generally for gamers as it is a halo card and it absolutely does not provide anywhere close to double the performance of a $700 RTX 3080. &gt; &gt;However, for some professionals, *two* RTX 3090s may give them exactly what they need as it is the only Ampere gaming card to support NVLink providing up to 112.5 GB/s of total bandwidth between two GPUs which when SLI‚Äôd together will allow them to access a massive 48GB of vRAM. SLI is no longer supported by NVIDIA for gaming, and emphasis will be placed on mGPU only as implemented by game developers. # [Digital Foundry Article](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2020-nvidia-geforce-rtx-3090-review) # [Digital Foundry Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeWo7BLN9Y) &gt;So there we have it. The RTX 3090 delivers - at best - 15 to 16 per cent more gaming performance than the RTX 3080. In terms of price vs performance, there is only one winner here. And suffice to say, we would expect to see factory overclocked RTX 3080 cards bite into the already fairly slender advantage delivered by Nvidia's new GPU king. Certainly in gaming terms then, the smart money would be spend on an RTX 3080, and if you're on a 1440p high refresh rate monitor and you're looking to maximise price vs performance, I'd urge you to look at the RTX 2080 Ti numbers in this review: if Nvidia's claims pan out, you'll be getting that and potentially more from the cheaper still RTX 3070. All of which raises the question - why make an RTX 3090 at all? &gt; &gt;The answers are numerous. First of all, PC gaming has never adhered to offering performance increases in line with the actual amount of money spent. Whether it's Titans, Intel Extreme processors, high-end motherboards or performance RAM, if you want the best, you'll end up paying a huge amount of money to attain it.

"Experience Switching 100% EV (Tesla) TLDR: Wife and I transitioned 100% EV (24' MYLR and 21' M3LR) from two ten year old ICE cars in the last couple months. Total cost to transition was just **$41,500** and we're saving $4,500 annually on electric vs. gas. Why doesn't everyone do this!? &amp;#x200B; **Our Experience:** Just wanted to document my experience transitioning entirely to Tesla within the last two months. Mid January, a deer stepped in front of my ICE. Wife and I are the types that tend to keep cars until the maintenance becomes a headache, and we both have been driving 8-9 year old cars that have been paid off for years, with a combined 350k miles between them. I knew the time was approaching with my car, but the deer expedited the process. &amp;#x200B; **Model Y (new) - Long Range** I honestly had not been tracking daily prices of the cars, and hadn't looked at what theses were going for for about a year or more. In my head I was assuming we were going to be putting down 60-70k to get what we wanted. The reality was much different, than expectation. I started by building exactly what I wanted, and going into research mode on options (there really aren't too many things to consider, surprisingly at least to me): \- Reddit (thanks) helped me quickly realize we didn't need EAP or FSD \- Long Range: yes please \- Bigger ties look nice, but the moment I realized it reduced range (nope, no thanks) \- Color: I guess I don't mind paying for blue, I like blue (personal preference) Then I found the 'inventory' tab, and noticed there were a lot of cars available. So I entered exactly what I built there, and saw I could get it sooner for $4,500 less. I don't consider myself impulsive. I bought it that night (ordered it?) I was driving the car 5 days later. $7,500 off the price from the point of sale discount from EV tax credit brought the total sale price down to the upper $30k's (wow! Half what I was expecting to pay, for a new car... I was in a good mood) &amp;#x200B; **Extras** We did have to hire a guy (licensed Electrician) to install a 110 foot line from our sub panel to the garage to put the Wall Charger in the garage. We had the foresight to install it in a way where it could hit both sides of the garage (foreshadowing) although at the time we had no idea just 6 weeks later we would be getting another Tesla. Cost $2,250 (wall charger included) &amp;#x200B; **Savings** It wasn't until the first week of driving the car (and a lot more research online - much of it here - THANK YOU!) that I started to realize just how much money I was saving from electric compared to gas. I live in Virginia, which already have a fairly low average cost per kWh... but my power company in particular charges just 9 cents per kWh, and when I changed to EV status with them, it dropped to 5 cents per kWh 11pm to 6am. I drive about 20k miles a year (mostly commuting) and much of that is winding 35mph roads that are fun to drive with beautiful scenery. I didn't realize two things when I bought the Model Y -- A) EV cars excel at savings when you're driving under 50MPH, and B) the regen breaking makes driving these roads SO much more enjoyable, safe, and efficient. The altitude change is minimal, but I'm averaging 210-220 Wh/mi after the first 15 miles of my commute every day... and hitting 190-200 on the way home for the same section. All while feeling like a kid in a goKart on these winding roads (deer, you got me here, but please please don't ruin this for me!) I did the math, and I'm going to save $3,125 annually now that I'm driving this car (electric compared to gas) vs the premium gas my 2015 ICE vehicle was consuming prior. This Model Y will pay for itself (become free) after 13 years... if I drove it that long. &amp;#x200B; **Model 3 (used)** My wife and I decided that whoever drives furthest on a given day would take the MYLR.

"Why Tesla deserves a look and probably a Buy at these Levels We know the story, Elon‚Äôs right leanings are causing his core customers to revolt. This has killed sentiment dropping the stock to uncanny low levels. A few assumptions: 1. Analysts expect Revenue 3 years out are expected to be 200 billion. 2. Tesla has had a P/S multiple between 6 and 28 historically I built a matrix pricing Tesla between 6 to 10x sales and looked at sales of 150,180,200,210,225 (-25%,-10%,base,5%,12.5%) on that revenue estimate This yields a market cap of 900 to 2,250 or a 3 year return ranging between 7.47% and 45.86% per year! They have also had minimal dilution in recent years. I know I know, Elon is doing irreparable harm to the Tesla brand! It‚Äôs just like chipotle with ecoli, VW cheated on emissions, Equifax leaking all our data, Wells Fargo opening accounts and so on. DOGE is set to terminate in July of 2026 starting the distancing from Trump For better or worse, fair or unfair, Tesla likely has a regulatory advantage in getting FSD approved thanks to Elon‚Äôs position. Overtime I expect Tesla will be valued like Apple, not legacy auto. Why? Well for one, Tesla doesn‚Äôt have a banking arm so that makes it far different than legacy auto for comparisons. Apple has lumpy iPhone sales followed by big fat juicy service revenue. Tesla, at maturity has the same potential. Lumpy car sales with subscriptions to FSD, Insurance, App Store, robo-taxi, repairs and maintenance, etc. this is the reason I used 6-10x sales above. These are around the multiple Apple has been valued at in recent years. Additionally, the following is True: They sell cars at retail prices to consumers whereas legacy auto sells cars wholesale to dealers. They are one of the few to make EVs profitable at scale and have been wise to lower prices to levels legacy auto can‚Äôt compete at. Tesla has many call options on its business with robotics and FSD Never mix politics and portfolios Best of Luck!

"It‚Äôs Not You, It‚Äôs Your Story: Why Branding Matters Many people say that building a brand is a very troublesome thing, and it is not necessary, but if you want to have a stable income and loyal customers, then the brand is very necessary, especially for those who want to take this as a full-time For people, brand awareness will allow you to go further. Click here to view website content [It‚Äôs Not You, It‚Äôs Your Story: Why Branding Matters](https://www.antdiy.vip/?p=951) In today‚Äôs fast-paced, overly-automated, and digitally-driven society, humanity is becoming the new premium. The internet constantly rewards us with convenience and instant gratification, making the human touch increasingly more scarce and coveted. In this environment, businesses can no longer afford to be faceless entities. To survive, businesses need to connect with audiences, pull at their heartstrings, and engage with them on a much deeper level than seen before. That‚Äôs where brand storytelling comes in. Brand storytelling is the cohesive narrative that weaves together the facts and emotions that your brand evokes. In addition to giving your customers reasons why they should buy a product or service, businesses need to start sharing the story behind their brand, why it exists, and why this matters, consistently across all communication. Brand storytelling is no longer a nice to have. It is a need to have, and what will ultimately maximize your business‚Äôs visibility, profit, and impact. Treat it as a compass for your marketing strategy, and the result will be a brand that is as profitable as it is captivating. &amp;#x200B; ## table of Contents * Consumers Recognize Your Brand * Consumers Trust Your Brand * Consumers Feel Connected to Your Brand * You Can Shape Customer Perception * Your Brand is your Proposition for Disruption * More than customers, build a tribe * You have got to Unleash Your Rebel Voice. * In a sea of sameness, be unforgettable. # Consumers Recognize Your Brand One of the main reasons you should build a brand in the first place is so that consumers can recognize your business. Ultimately, you want your customers to see one of your ads and immediately know it‚Äôs from your business, even if your logo or business name is nowhere to be found. When consumers are at this point, it means that they truly know your brand. When people recognize your brand on their social media feeds or billboards around the city, they are more likely to think of your brand when they are ready to make a purchase. For this reason, your brand should be consistent across all marketing channels ‚Äî traditional and digital. Your brand should also tie into your product/service experience. When branding is done right, consumers feel certain emotions when seeing your brand. For example, if you have an adventurous brand, consumers should be inspired to run up the closest mountain upon seeing your ad. If your brand is more nostalgic, certain happy memories should be triggered by your brand. A consistent brand also includes customer experiences. Consumers who interact with your brand should see your brand values in action when they make a purchase, and they should be able to recall those values when they see your logo. When you are recognizable to your customers, it sets you apart from the competition. Ultimately, you want your customers to see one of your ads and immediately know it‚Äôs from your business, even if your logo or business name is nowhere to be found. # Consumers Trust Your Brand People stick with brands because the brands are predictable. Even if the consumers know they aren‚Äôt getting the best service, there is comfort in knowing exactly what to expect. Humans feel better about a company when they can anticipate its next moves. When it comes to brand consistency, predictability is critical. Consistency makes consumers trust your brand, and that consistency leads to more positive feelings toward your brand. Consumers should know what to expect and what the outcome will",Rebel,Tesla,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ANTDIYdropshipping/comments/iki8ij/its_not_you_its_your_story_why_branding_matters/
"Summary and Thoughts about the RID #**Overall Thoughts** I came away from the RID feeling better about my investment. Not way better, but better. As many here predicted, they put on a quality session which I think largely helped to sway investor sentiment to the positive. I like to think that the quality of these meetings (and the earnings calls) is borne by their honesty and transparency. I know some investors believe they have not been honest. I think Sumit's willingness to spend 3 hours at the Happy Hour meeting also contributed to the honesty and transparency. While I believe they have made some mistakes and misjudged the sales process in general and even more specifically the automotive sales process, I do not believe they have been dishonest. Having said that, it is management‚Äôs job to shine an optimistic light on the situation, the degree to which that is done is always the question. The line between optimism and dishonestly lies within the eye of the beholder. Obviously, for those of you who were not able to attend, you can watch the video recording. Some of the comments below are simply a recap of the Q&amp;A session with some of my color commentary added. #**TL;DR** Peppered throughout the RID, there were quite a few references to being close to closing a deal in the industrial space. Sumit said his expectation was to close an industrial deal before September. They are making investments for the future ‚Äì sensor fusion and military. This could be a signal that they believe there will be a future! ;-) Meaning they expect to close some industrial deals soon. In summary, I think their plan for the rest of this year is‚Ä¶ 1. Close an industrial deal or deals soon 2. Hope the stock price appreciates asymmetrically 3. Raise a round of capital 4. Get some kind of early traction in the military vertical and hope for more asymmetry in the stock price 5. Exploit the edge perception and sensor fusion for the industrial vertical (sensor fusion may be 2026) 6. If they can throw in some sort of news in the automotive space that would be a bonus. #**Sumit‚Äôs lesson learned** The very first question for Sumit was what mistakes has he made? He said he underestimated the technology adoption (this is essentially the sales process). I would say that it is very common for someone who is transitioning from the technology world to the sales world. That is, most of the time, the general thought is that a good product will win, perhaps even sell itself. Generally, it takes some tough real-world experiences to learn that isn‚Äôt usually the case. #**Military** Military ‚Äì the strategy here is that Microvision already owns a number of the building blocks that can be used to create appropriate products. In other words they are not starting from scratch. The other aspect, as Anubhav mentioned, there is a lot of investment flowing into defense tech these days so Microvision wants to be in a position to take advantage of this. A question was asked about whether or not Microvision is going direct to the DoD or will work via a prime. Sumit said one of his lessons learned is you must have direct access to the buyer. Therefore, for military business, Microvision must let the DoD know what products they have and what problems they solve. They still intend to partner with a prime in order to go-to-market. They need to crawl, walk, and then potentially run. Glen mentioned it is a changing landscape with regard to the military needs and their sourcing practices. What are the applications for which Microvision has a fit? Autonomous vehicles and sensor fusion. Drones ‚Äì over the last 3 to 5 years there has been a massive expansion in drones for surveying, mapping, and detection. Microvision would need to repackage their sensor to be light weight. Solid state is important. Do drones require 360 degrees of FOV? There is a lot of fidelity required looking down ‚Äì so 180 degrees of FOV needed.

"Trade in a lightly used ES 300h for a GS 350? Hey all, I've had my 2022 ES 300h Ultra Luxury for just over 7 months now, and I just don't love it. There's a lot to like, but I never truly loved it for several reasons. When I was shopping for a car, I knew I wanted a hybrid or EV, so I used the MSRPs of Tesla Model 3, Toyota Camry, and Honda Accord to set my budget. I didn't like any of these, so started looking for used Lexus ES 300H in the same price range. I put a $35k CAD down payment on a $58k CAD car (that includes all taxes and fees), thinking I'd pay off the rest in about a year. I felt sick to my stomach after splashing such a big amount of money on a car, and the guilt has been eating me up ever since. My monthly payment is $552, which is not great, though not the worst either. But, I just can't fathom doing this for 3.5 more years, let alone make a $20k lump sum to pay off the loan. I test drove a 2017 GS 350 on two different occasions and enjoyed the smooth V6 and higher build quality. It's like they cheaped out a lot with the ES interior. I saw one today with the Executive package for $28k with 110k kms and test drove it. It comes with winter tires and a second set of wheels. Not a bad price, but the dealer lowballed me with a trade-in value of a whopping $38k, when I know for a fact that the value ranges from $38k-$49k for the model year and trim, and I showed the manager that this value came straight from AutoTrader, yet they acted dumb and ""oh this looks way different than our valuation, what could the reason be?"" I know the deal with wholesale values and all, but considering the fact that I have brand new winter tires, extended warranty, and 23k kms on the odometer, I think that figure is unfair and expected at least $45k from a Lexus dealer. They'll have no problem selling it for the same price they sold it to me or more and still make a profit. They seemed like they were willing to work on their valuation, but I wasn't prepared to fold and commit to a purchase on the spot. Tl;dr, am I stupid to trade in a perfectly good, economical car for one that will essentially be paid off, even though it is obviously more dated, driven way more, and is a gas guzzler? Moral of the story is that I realized that I would much rather pay cash for a car than have the burden of a monthly payment on my shoulders.",Rebel,Tesla,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lexus/comments/1isvxli/trade_in_a_lightly_used_es_300h_for_a_gs_350/

Well, the emphasis here is on the word ""pursuit,"" but I'll do my best to justify what comes close to ""perfection."" I know the sub has been actively discussing the P Series since Segway's announcement in March of this year, and with initial crowdfunding deliveries just taking place this week, I hope to put my experience with eScooters in general and with the P100S, specifically, to use here. First, an important preface... \--- # Who am I and why is this initial impressions review worth reading? Based out of Los Angeles in Southern California, I've spent the last few years actively involved in the PEV community, primarily focused on full-on electric vehicles‚ÄîI daily drive a Tesla Model 3, so my normal commute is also powered by an electric motor‚Äîbut honed in on electric scooters. My miles have been accrued on everything from the wide roster of Segway-Ninebot consumer models, to more niche and high-performing Nami and Wolf models out in the wild. As Los Angeles has a mature rideshare network in place, I've also put in countless miles/hours on varying models from Bird, Spin, Evo, etc. Given Segway's rise to stardom in the industry, I planned on purchasing a pair of Ninebot Max scooters (one for me and one for my wife) at the tail-end of last year, but when Segway announced the GT and P Series earlier this year, I kicked my research into high gear, connecting with active people in the r/ElectricScooters subreddit and various others to try and gain as much of a pre-purchase education as possible. My personal use-case and goal were to arrive upon the best possible option for a city explorer, versatile eScooter, loaded with tech, capable of robust top-speed, and toward the top of the charts in terms of efficiency/range. While I may use my eScooter for occasional commutes, my general purpose is recreational riding, exploration, and light errand running across LA's Westside. When Segway finalized the spec sheet and launched the Kickstarter, my wife and I pulled the trigger on a pair of P100S. Fortunate to be based out of Los Angeles, our units were day-one deliveries, taking just a single day to go from Segway's Katy, Texas distribution center to our home address. \--- # The Personal Rider Details to Consider: * Rider Weight (Total payload during miles tested as of this writing): 165 lbs * Ambient Temperatures (during miles tested as of this writing): 70-78 F * Road Surfaces/Types Tested: Primarily city/residential (newly paved and older, rougher), along with light trail (dirt and sand) * Hill Grades Tested: Flat ground, steep descents, and 20+% hill climbs * Miles Ridden on P100S as of 10/1/22: 68.6 miles * P100S units on-hand and mileage distribution between them: Two units on-hand, with 50/50 mileage distribution between them \--- # Segway P100S Essential Specs: * Range: 33.9 miles under near-max performance ride mode or \~60 miles under full eco ride mode (more on this in a dedicated section later) * Motor Type and Output: 650 W single motor with 1350 W peak output * Brakes: 5.5"" ventilated, mechanical disc brakes with rear electric regen brake * Acceleration and Top Speed: 0-15 in 2.8 seconds, with a 30 MPH top speed * Hill Grade Capability: 23% * Total Payload Capacity: 265 lbs * Suspension: Front &amp; Rear Dedicated Suspension (Torsion-Bar Type) * Tires: Automobile-grade 10.5"" pneumatic all season (tubeless, self-sealing) * Battery Pack: 1086 wH * Charge Time (0-100%): \~7 hours * Water Rating: IPX5 body and IPX7 battery pack * Lighting: 10 W LED daytime running light, multicolor RGB accent lights, Segway welcome light (rear puddle lights), full turn signal lights (front and rear",Rebel,Tesla,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricScooters/comments/xtaxlp/segway_p100s_in_pursuit_of_perfection_initial/
"Tata Motors Analysis. Reposting my 2-months old research. Most of the investors buy in impulsive mode based on story telling by media and influencers without looking into the financial language and fundamentals of stock. You all will be seduced by PE of 6 but global giants like toyota, VM, Hyundai and all german automakers are also trading in 4-7 pe range. So it‚Äôs not a value buy, but a value trap. The Analysis(Posted on SubReddit: IndiaGrowthstocks) Pricing Power- High-quality businesses must have the ability to pass on costs to customers without losing market share. **TataMotors has Moderate pricing power**. JLR provides some strength, but the PV and CV segments dilute overall pricing ability. Pricing Structure **- Passenger Vehicles (PV):** Limited pricing power in the mass-market segment because competition is intense. Tata's EVs ( Nexon EV) have some pricing power due to a **dominant market share in India (58%- nov 2024 data**), but **i**s **loosing market share to new entrants** like MG, BYD, and Hyundai.( **Its ev share has dropped from 74% to 58%-FADA REPORT)** **JLR (Luxury Vehicles):** **Better pricing power due to strong branding,** especially for models like Range Rover and Defender. However, luxury demand is cyclical and tied to economic conditions.(Top 3 Market are North America, Europe and china and **it will face strong competition from brands like BYD and Tesla** which **have both technological and manufacturing edge.** Margins- Focus on high-margin businesses that reflect strong moats and operational efficiency. Tata Motors **Margins are low and cyclical but have been improving due to better operational efficiency and product mix.** **EBITDA Margins cyclical,** past 5 years it has ranged from 2% to 14% and has not remained consistent.JLR contributes higher margins (15-17%) but is volatile. PV and CV segments operate on thin margins (5-8%), heavily influenced by input costs and competition. Capital Intensity- Asset-light businesses are favoured as they require less reinvestment and scale more efficiently. Tata Motors **Capital intensity is high, which reduces free cash flow scalability.** **Automobiles are inherently capital-intensive**..Tata Motors invests heavily in R&amp;D (6-7% of revenue) and manufacturing facilities, especially for EVs.**The EV business requires significant upfront capital for battery manufacturing, charging infrastructure, and product development.** Free Cash Flow (FCF)- High and consistent FCF generation is critical for reinvestment and shareholder returns. Tata Motors FCF is improving but inconsistent because of the cyclical nature and high reinvestment needs.**Positive FCF generation was supported by better operating cash flow from JLR in the past few yearsand this led to the spike in stock price**, **but recently JLR has cut the FCF guidance by 30% due to high capex. High CapEx and working capital needs constrain FCF growth**, particularly in the EV segment for Tata motors. ROCE- A high and stable ROCE reflects efficient capital allocation and business strength.

This is a long one. **Some context here is due:** I'm a mod and frequent poster at r/electricvehicles and r/selfdrivingcars, and I've been watching the Chinese car industry for a few years now as I started cluing into developments back in 2021 or so, when I also started r/chinacars.

"WHY I think MrBeast isn‚Äôt the same anymore I‚Äôve seen a lot of people on the subreddit talk about how MrBeast has been boring recently, or just not the same, or how some of the crew arn‚Äôt themselves. I‚Äôve been watching MrBeast for around 6 years, and I‚Äôve always been a huge fan of his videos especially as a kid, but I also have to agree. MrBeast just isn‚Äôt the same anymore, and here‚Äôs why I think one of the biggest factors for me is how the videos are structured now compared to back then. Older videos feel a lot more like a big group of friends just fucking around, paying a bunch of money and giving it away to ACTUAL strangers. This goes along with something else I‚Äôve seen on this subreddit, in the newer videos, the OG crew just doesn‚Äôt seem very happy or excited and everything feels forced. While I don‚Äôt think thats entirely true, it‚Äôs super easy to see why. The new videos just don‚Äôt put the focus on them, they only put a focus on creating a story, making a challenge, having some random character accomplish the mission while Jimmy leads, with the rest of the group acting as background characters. This is almost a complete 180 from what was seen in older videos: the GROUP was the focus, them fucking around and being friends was the entertainment. It felt real not because they weren‚Äôt depressed or because of something behind the scenes, instead it felt real because‚Ä¶ it was. It was a group of guys hanging out, doing stupid shit with their rich friend, giving away money and inviting others to join, letting their own humor and personalities shine too. Compare that to today where most guests are either from older videos or already have great experience in social media; and with the focus not being on the group, but instead being on the story of the video, and keeping younger audiences engaged throughout. It doesn‚Äôt feel true not necessarily because it‚Äôs entirely fake, but because it isn‚Äôt a group of guys hanging out anymore. It‚Äôs not the type of video though, MrBeast has been making challenge and ‚Äúworlds most expensive‚Äù videos ever since his start, among other things. But a clear difference is the production value. Modern MrBeast is a brand and company, so every video had a high production value and TEAMS of employees to make sure everything is right. Older videos instead seemed very on the spot and obviously, much cheaper. In my opinion, I prefer the older content because of this fact. The newer videos don‚Äôt feel like their being made by friends, they feel like their being made by a company and large teams of people, who are also pushing products to me. The newer videos feel corporate and oddly fake to me. His older videos instead feel like they were made by friends, though they were cheaper, they felt much more real and relatable. Even in his more expensive videos such as ‚Äúopening the worlds cheapest store‚Äù or ‚Äúlast to leave Tesla‚Äù the focus was still on the friends and the group, plus those helped because of their actions. It felt relatable without feeling too corporate. But is that really a bad thing though? After all MrBeast is a brand now, not just a person or a group. And attempting to push more towards younger ages is never a bad thing, plus all of the philanthropy work Jimmy has done is simply incredible. In the past, MrBeast was definitely for a little more older audiences, but now it‚Äôs being pushed to much younger children. Is that bad? Absolutely not, but it means that some of his older audiences simply outgrew him, especially after growing up on what he had to offer years prior. Which is why I think he simply isn‚Äôt the same anymore. He isn‚Äôt awful or even bad now, one can argue he‚Äôs still very entertaining even for older audiences, but he‚Äôs definitely not the same as he was back then.",Rebel,Tesla,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/MrBeast/comments/1bun4jr/why_i_think_mrbeast_isnt_the_same_anymore/

Most of the recommended lights won't have all of them, but these are things to look for when shopping for lights: * Neutral white tint - the [vast majority](https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/5yjqcr/poll_preferred_color_temperature/) of people with an opinion prefer a color temperature that's within the range of direct sunlight, which is generally marketed as ""neutral white"", but sometimes as ""warm white"" * A lack of red, or especially green off-tints, beam artifacts and tint shift from the center of the beam to the edges * A user interface that does not require cycling through different modes to turn off, and does not change modes every time the light is turned off * A lack of blinking modes within the standard mode rotation, either because the light doesn't have any, or they're ""hidden"" by being accessed in a different manner than the usual modes * An IP waterproofing rating - most good lights are rated for IPX8 with the depth and duration of submersion specified by the manufacturer * A lack of timed stepdowns. Some lights only produce their maximum output for a few minutes at a time. While some powerful lights can get too hot to hold if run on high constantly, the hardware necessary to measure temperature and only reduce power if the light is actually too hot costs only a few cents, but many lights won't overheat badly anyway * Full-spectrum, or high-CRI for more accurate color rendering. Color rendering index, or CRI is the most common measurement of this; average LEDs are about 70. Over 80 is decent, and over 90 is excellent. The highest I've heard of from an LED is [99](http://budgetlightforum.com/node/60236). This is more important for seeing detail than absolute output and can be the difference between a stick and a snake on the trail. * A sub-lumen moonlight mode (for general-use lights) * A user interface that allows access to the lowest and highest modes from off without having to cycle through other modes * A user interface where a single click turns the light on in a reasonable mode, and another single click turns it off. # About specs Lumens are total output. Don't worry about small differences in output. You probably can't detect a 10% difference in lumens with your eyes, and 20% is barely noticeable. It takes 4 times the lumens to look twice as bright. Candela is intensity, which translates to throw distance. FL1 throw numbers are about right for detecting large objects; cut them in half for seeing clearly. Extreme throw distances also run in to limits imposed by human vision and by backscatter in the atmosphere. Warmer tints have less backscatter. FL1 runtime numbers are to 10% output and can be misleading. Look for a review with a runtime graph. Performance specs for AA and AAA powered lights are usually given with NiMH rechargeable batteries. Alkalines don't perform as well, and may leak corrosive electrolyte. If you want something particularly powerful or long-lasting, you should probably skip right to the [18650](ht",Rebel,Tesla,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/a8hjbv/arbitrary_list_of_popular_lights_winter_solstice/
"The Elon Musk Playbook: The 25 Proven Tactics That Built a Trillion-Dollar Empire. Here are the strategies that the world's richest man used to built PayPal, Tesla, SpaceX, Starlink and X.AI. Plus the super prompt you can use to founder like Elon As someone who's always been fascinated by how visionaries turn wild ideas into world-changing realities, I dove deep into Elon Musk's story. Drawing from Walter Isaacson's gripping 2023 biography *Elon Musk* and the insightful Founders Podcast video ""How Elon Works,"" I wanted to create something truly valuable for this community. This isn't just a list ‚Äì it's a comprehensive guide packed with actionable insights and real-world examples from Musk's companies. Why Musk? He's not just the richest person alive but a master builder. His strategies aren't about luck ‚Äì they're about relentless execution, first-principles thinking, and pushing humanity forward. This post aims to be helpful (practical steps), inspirational (stories of overcoming odds), educational (backed by data and history), and comprehensive (deep dives into each tactic). To set the stage, here‚Äôs a quick table of his key companies: |Company|Founded|Key Milestones|2025 Valuation (Approx.)|Musk's Role/Ownership| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |**PayPal**|1998|2002: Sold to eBay for $1.5B; revolutionized online payments.|\~$70B (public market cap)|Co-founder; sold stake post-acquisition.| |**Tesla**|2003|2010: IPO; 2024: Cybertruck launch; 2025: Robotaxi unveil.|\~$815B (market cap)|CEO; \~12% ownership (\~$98B value).| |**SpaceX**|2002|2008: First private orbital launch; 2025: Mars cargo mission planned. Starlink: 6M+ subscribers.|$350B (SpaceX total); Starlink subset \~$75B|Founder/CEO; \~42% ownership (\~$147B value).| |**Neuralink**|2016|2023: Human trials approved; 2025: First commercial implants.|\~$5-8B (private est.)|Co-founder; majority stake.| |**The Boring Co.**|2016|2021: Vegas Loop operational; 2025: Chicago O'Hare expansion.|\~$6B (private est.)|Founder; majority stake.| |**xAI**|2023|2023: Grok AI launch; 2025: $5B funding round.|$113B|Founder; \~54% ownership (\~$61B value).| # 1. Question Every Requirement Musk's core philosophy: Never accept ""requirements"" blindly. In the biography, he insists every rule must trace back to a person ‚Äì even if it's him ‚Äì and be challenged. This stems from first-principles thinking, breaking problems to fundamentals. Example: At SpaceX, Musk questioned NASA's rocket cost norms, leading to the ""idiot index"" (raw material cost vs. final product). Result? Falcon 9 costs dropped from $60M to $2.7M per launch. At Tesla, he grilled suppliers on battery specs, slashing Model 3 production costs by 30%. Inspirational Angle: Musk arrived in the US with nothing but turned Zip2 (his first company) into a $307M sale by questioning outdated mapping tech. ""When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor,"" he says. Data Viz: SpaceX Launch Cost Reduction (ASCII Chart): $60M | ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà (Pre-Musk norms) $2.7M| ‚ñà (Falcon 9, 2020s) Application: In your startup, audit every process ‚Äì e.g., why use expensive software? Challenge it weekly to cut waste by 20-50%. # 2. Delete Any Part of the Process You Can Musk's mantra: Delete ruthlessly, then add back only 10% if needed. This fights bureaucracy and bloat. Example: At Twitter (now X), post-acquisition in 2022, he deleted 75% of staff and features, streamlining to focus on core. At The Boring Company, he deleted complex tunnel designs, reducing Vegas Loop costs to $10M/mile vs. $1B/mile for traditional subways. Educational Insight: Isaacson notes this led to SpaceX's reusable rockets ‚Äì deleting disposable parts saved billions. Starlink's 6,000+ satellites launched cheaply because Musk deleted over-engineering. Inspirational: After PayPal's sale, Musk could've retired but deleted comfort to start SpaceX, risking everything.

"Tesla Earnings: The Old Used Kleenex Trick Works Again Well... Tesla bulls cheered after one of the worst earnings reports in company history (maybe even *the* worst). Here is the high level takeaway from Barron's: ""*Tesla stock is surging, but make no mistake: The quarter wasn‚Äôt good. The stock reaction is more of a lesson in expectations and the stock market rather than a financial one.* *Sales, operating profit, and net income fell 9%, 66%, and 39% year over year. That belies how weak the EV business is currently. From peak quarterly levels, Tesla‚Äôs sales are 25% lower and net income is 77% lower. First-quarter operating profit is down 90% from a fourth-quarter 2022 peak of $3.9 billion.*"" (Source: [Tesla: Just How Bad Was This Quarter?](https://www.barrons.com/livecoverage/tesla-earnings-stock-price-musk/card/just-how-bad-was-this-quarter)) I keep using my facetious tech-jargony term: ERDF (Elon Reality Distortion Field) to explain how Elon can overcome even the worst news with hype. But it is a real thing! And it really works. Here is the bottom line if you are a Tesla bull: Elon can tell the markets to ignore all of 2025, plummeting sales, self-created political drama and chaos, complete lack of focus in his leadership at the company, brand damage, endless delays, failed product launches (e.g., Cybertruck), rising competition, need to replace 4M computers in their cars to get anything resembling FSD so they don't get sued (again), and losing 90% of the company's operating profit and turn it into a juicy buying opportunity. The ticker doesn't lie. The stock goes up as the profit goes down (dramatically), driving the P/E ratio even further away from reality, now approaching jaw-dropping \~150x. And the stock still going up this morning. Bulls win. Again. For those of us outside the grip of the ERDF, here is my take on the earnings: It was basically a used Kleenex being used by Elon to clean up his \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (you fill in the blank in the comments- make us laugh). It was the same old news being reused to wipe away the reality of a failing and desperate company. **----End main post. Begin TLDR analysis. Don't read it if you are just going to complain----** Below is one obvious fact, three used Kleenex, and what I see priced into the stock at this time: **Fact:** Trump is indeed giving Elon the widely expected quid pro quo deal for buying him the White House. Remember the tariff ""news"" that was released right at the same time Tesla's horrid sales numbers were released a few weeks ago? Well, we got the same thing for the predictable dumpster fire of an earnings report yesterday. Trump is moving the macro elements in the markets by timing his ""tariff on/off"" switch to boost a single stock of the company owned by the person that got him elected. It's simple: Elon buys Trump the White House. Trump buys Elon more time to make is car company ""not-a-car-company"" by keeping the stock pumped. Elon is acting as a heat shield for Trump by doing the dirty work of cutting jobs with DOGE and Trump is acting as a heat shield for Tesla's stock. I bet we will see another White House sales special when the ""low cost"" car comes up for sale too. **Used Kleenex #1:** ERDF has achieved FSD mode as long as Elon keeps his hand on the wheel 2-3 days out of the week for Tesla. The news that was already known by the law mandates the term for Special Advisors to the President be limited to 130-days per calendar year, was deployed again. This same (not actual news) news release was already made and already got the stock to pop. But Elon isn't really leaving. According to the man himself, he is still going to be splitting his time between DOGE and Tesla, giving each a few days a week. And don't forget about SpaceX, X, xAI, Neuralink, The Boring Company, 14-kids and counting, and all the other stuff he spends his time on like gaming. But trust him: He is really going to focus this time.

"My team and I have spent over a year analyzing word-of-mouth success stories, looking for patterns. Here's everything we've learned. Enjoy! We wanted to really [deconstruct the phenomenon of word-of-mouth](http://www.referralcandy.com/blog/how-to-get-word-of-mouth) and explain it in a way that's easy for entrepreneurs to understand. We read all the books‚Äì [Made To Stick](http://www.referralcandy.com/blog/made-to-stick), Tipping Point, [Contagious](http://www.referralcandy.com/blog/contagious), Unleashing The Ideavirus, you name it. And we've been analyzing everything from Fortune 500 companies to new ideas on Kickstarter. Here's what we've learnt. # There are 3 parts to getting word-of-mouth: 1. Make a Wow product that's actually worth talking about 2. Seed the Wow ‚Äì make sure it gets into the hands of people who'll love to talk about it 3. Just Add Grease ‚Äì make it as easy as possible for people to talk about you So let's start with WOW. # There are two things that go into a Wow: 1. [Unexpected Utility](http://www.referralcandy.com/blog/unexpected-utility-word-of-mouth-marketing/) (innovation), and 2. a [Meaningful Story](http://www.referralcandy.com/blog/storytelling-in-marketing-11-examples/) (marketing). Let's go through examples of each. # MAKE A WOW PRODUCT, PT 1: CREATE UNEXPECTED UTILITY A product has Unexpected Utility when it solves a specific problem better than most people had previously thought possible, and at a lower price than people might've imagined it to cost. # Examples of Unexpected Utility in a New Product Class &gt; ""What we want to do is make a leapfrog product that is way smarter than any mobile device has ever been, and super-easy to use. This is what (the) iPhone is. "" - Steve Jobs in 2007, launching the iPhone ## Apple iPhone Like the iPod before it, the iPhone broke into a new class of products. It allowed people to do more with their mobile device than they were ever able to before. This made it immensely newsworthy, despite its initial flaws. As of March 2015, over 700,000,000 iPhones have been sold. ## Other Examples * [Dropbox](http://www.referralcandy.com/blog/dropbox) * [Tesla Model S](http://www.referralcandy.com/blog/tesla) * Lily cam # Examples of Unexpected Utility by being Extreme / Best In Class &gt; ""The public tends to be, as they should, interested in things that are precedent and superlatives."" ‚Äì Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla Motors &amp; SpaceX ## Coolest Cooler Why would anybody want to talk about a cooler? It's a box that you put your drinks in. Well, the Coolest Cooler does much more than that‚Äì it's got Bluetooth speakers, a blender, a USB charger, an LED lid light... and that's not even half of it. They raised $13 million dollars on Kickstarter‚Äì260 times their $50,000 target. ## Other Examples: * Under Armour * Early Google # MAKE A WOW PRODUCT, PT 2: TELL A MEANINGFUL STORY &gt; ""At the end of the day, brand helps customers answer THE question, Which one should I buy?"" ‚Äì Marc Barros, Contour co-founder. If you want more word-of-mouth, you need to figure out what your story is. It needs to be simple and sticky, so that people who love you know what to say about you. You can't leave this one up to chance. According to startup icon 'FAKE GRIMLOCK', there are 3 questions you need to answer to develop a 'Minimum Viable Personality': 1. How do you change your customer's life? 2. What do you stand for? 3. What do you hate? # Examples of Meaningful Storytelling: ## GoldieBlox GoldieBlox isn't pitched as just another toy marketed at girls. Rather, it's sold as a movement, a way of improving the world by correcting the gender inequality in engineering. They raised over $285,000 on Kickstarter, smashing their $150,000 goal. ## Other examples * Everlane * TOMS * GoPro # SEED DISCOVERY ‚Äì PUT THE WOW IN THE RIGHT HANDS &gt; ""Sell one.

I'm Samik Chatterjee, the analyst at JPMorgan here. For the next company at the tech forum, we have the pleasure of hosting BlackBerry. BlackBerry has transformed from a smartphone manufacturer to a leading security-focused enterprise software and services provider. The BlackBerry‚Äôs portfolio competes in a number of interesting markets, including cyber security, automotive software and critical event management. Today, we will be focusing more on BlackBerry's automotive software, which is QNX. It is my pleasure to introduce Steve Rai, BlackBerry's Chief Financial Officer; and John Wall, BlackBerry's Co-Head of BlackBerry Technology Solutions. And thank you both, Steve and John for attending and participating in this conference. Look forward to an interesting discussion. I will probably just start you off here, Steve, in a sense,* we- before we dive into Q&amp;A for the benefit of investors, reengaging with the BlackBerry story, who probably know BlackBerry from a smartphone days more, can we just start with a high-level overview of the business today? Steve Rai Sure.* Thank you, and pleased to be here today. So, while we don't build phones anymore, we absolutely continue to leverage the strong software and security heritage of the company. Our trusted software platform, which we call Spark, can connect, secure and manage every endpoint in the IoT landscape. So, it leverages next-gen threat protection, intelligent security, and provides a single pane of glass to manage the environment. Further, through AI and machine learning, it continues to get smarter and provides excellent return on investment. So, this area represents a $38 billion and growing addressable market. Beyond securing enterprises, our solutions also enable critical infrastructure such as securing utilities, automotive safety through QNX, which as John will speak to, and securing people through our AtHoc critical event management solution. We've got deep credentials which have been hardened in the regulated space. At nearly all of the G20 governments and top 10 global banks as well as the top 9 automotive OEMs, we've got them as customers. Our solutions are equally applicable and provide significant value to enterprises of all sizes. So, I believe all this and the strong financial position of the company, of course, sets us up very well to serve the markets that we‚Äôre in*. And it plays right into the macro trends that we're seeing, including an ever-increasing mobile and work-from-anywhere workforce, rapid IoT proliferation, and an ever-increasing threat landscape, which, of course, the unprecedented cyberattacks of 2020 underscore, and the evolution of vehicles and smart city infrastructure that John Wall will speak to.

Volvo had itself been acquired in 2010 by Geely, a China-based auto brand that sells vehicles under the brands Geely Auto, Lotus, Lynk &amp; Co, Proton, and Volvo.

The CCP can theoretically shut them down at any moment without warning (see: $DIDI). 2. The stocks are actually ADRs and based in the Cayman Islands, so you don't even own the actual companies. * By comparison, GGPI is headquartered in Sweden and already US-listed on the Nasdaq. * Polestar is already an established OEM, leveraging the strategic relationship with Volvo in manufacturing, design and marketing. Hence, the investment opportunity is lower risk since Polestar is not a start-up. * As with most present-day multinationals, there is some China-related production risk.

You see, two very well-respected investing firms named Ancora and The Pershing Square Foundation, led by a very well-respected investor named Bill Ackman, has joined forces with Peltz/Trian/Perlmutter, all of which are most beloved and best-respected folks among Disney investors/shareholders, in Disney proxy war, meaning that the chance of Peltz/Trian/Perlmutter/Ancora/Ackman completely taking over Disney and becoming majority shareholder or even taking every single Disney shares is now at 100%: &gt; **Nelson Peltz‚Äôs Fight for Disney Board Seats Gets New Ally in Investment Firm Ancora Holdings** &gt; &gt; The boutique firm issued a public letter supporting the activist investor‚Äôs efforts &gt; &gt; Nelson Peltz has a new ally in his efforts to get a seat on the Disney board: the activist investor Ancora. &gt; &gt; The boutique investment firm, which typically focuses on family wealth and asset management, penned a letter to fellow Disney shareholders supporting Peltz and his firm, Trian Fund Management in the quest for access to the boardroom. &gt; &gt; ‚ÄúWe believe Disney is saying the right things about restructuring and transforming the enterprise,‚Äù Ancora Holdings Group Chairman and CEO Frederick DiSanto and Ancora Alternatives President James Chadwick wrote in the letter dated Tuesday. ‚ÄúNonetheless, the addition of a shareholder representative or investor-designated directors to the board can help ensure that these efforts are carried out in the most effective way.‚Äù &gt; &gt; Hoping to ‚Äúavert an election contest following a year of distractions and disappointing performance‚Äù the letter called for shareholders to encourage the board ‚Äúto pursue a viable compromise‚Äù with Peltz and Trian, the letter said. &gt; &gt; Disney last week roundly rebuffed Peltz‚Äôs latest effort to obtain board seats for Trian, maintaining that the effort is rooted in former Marvel Entertainment chairman Ike Perlmutter‚Äôs ‚Äúlongstanding personal agenda‚Äù against Disney CEO Bob Iger. &gt; &gt; Perlmutter has joined his considerable stake in Disney stock, about 25 million shares, with Trian‚Äôs holdings of about 8 million shares, in the campaign to place Peltz and allies on the board. &gt; &gt; Peltz renewed his fight with Disney after the company‚Äôs quarterly results were released last month, after backing off in February, when Iger announced sweeping cuts of $3 billion, including 7,000 layoffs at The House of Mouse. &gt; &gt; But despite a fiscal fourth-quarter report that showed gains in Disney+ subscribers , revenue growth of 5% and earnings per share that topped Wall Street expectations, Peltz and Trian found continued fault with Iger‚Äôs leadership and the languishing Disney stock price. &gt; &gt; Ancora, which has previously joined other activist campaigns, has now joined the fight, even though it did not disclose how much Disney stock it holds. &gt; &gt; ‚ÄúA degree of shareholder-driven change is certainly warranted in Disney‚Äôs boardroom following an extended period of absentminded governance, ineffective succession planning, polarizing actions and sustained value destruction,‚Äù the firm‚Äôs letter states. ‚ÄúMany of Disney‚Äôs current directors and executives bear responsibility for lapses that have undermined the company‚Äôs positioning in the exceedingly competitive and ever-changing entertainment world. &gt; &gt; ‚ÄúWhile it has been argued that challenges largely stem from the tenure of Bob Chapek, the board was in the driver‚Äôs seat before, during and after that time,‚Äù it continues. ‚ÄúThe upshot is that Disney shareholders have incurred meaningful losses,‚Äù and the company has ‚Äúdramatically underperformed the S&amp;P 500 Media &amp; Entertainment Index‚Äù the letter states. &gt; &gt; It also accuses the board of overseeing ‚Äúa deterioration of what was once the most unifying brand in the world,‚Äù by ‚Äúallowing Disney to devote shareholders‚Äô resources to a number of politicized initiatives.‚Äù It ",Rebel,Tesla,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18zrbp1/as_ive_said_before_disney_will_completely_cease/
"I test drove EVERY trim of the Nissan Ariya 2023 and Bought a CPO Version - Ask Me Any Questions? Backstory: As a guy in my 50s I wanted something with a more classy interior (think suede, Napa leather, wood trim panels). So I naturally gravitated to the luxury brands (Audi/BMW/MB) but because my budget for a used (2021+) EV was under $40K I could only look at the bottom lines of those storied brands (i.e. MB EQB250/300). But those vehicles are more targeted to people in their 20s. The cockpit of the EQB is more like a star-wars cruiser rather than a classy interior. So I moved on. The EV6/Ioniq 5 platforms are great. Truly impressed with the fast charging. I rented an EV6 for a bit and I just couldn't get over how cheap the interior was. Lots of hard plastics and if I was going on road trips every weekend, I could overlook that because the DC fast charging really is about 20 minutes 20-80%. So I moved on. Mach E was nice but I wanted more luxury (i.e. HUD, Napa, Bose audio). So I moved on. Toyota/Subarua's twins just looked weird on the interior. So I moved on. I'm a VAG guy. the e-tron (like a lot of Audi's) isn't a good value proposition and the ID.4 just had too many glitches. I actually first looked at these 12 months ago when I was getting my car serviced but there was a stop-sell order on all 2023 models and VW bought back all of the cars of the dealer lot. Another 2024 stop sell order put me off them. So I relucantly looked at the Nissan Ariya. Brand new the 2023 models were $50K-$60K and since they (after just one year) are selling for $25k-$30k, I thought they were just glorified leafs. But wow, how wrong was I. You can find a great tool that allows you to easily compare trims here [https://www.nissanusa.com/interactivebrochures/electric-hybrid-cars/ariya/ariya-trims/index.html?nav=top&amp;nav=top](https://www.nissanusa.com/interactivebrochures/electric-hybrid-cars/ariya/ariya-trims/index.html?nav=top&amp;nav=top) You'll see even the base trim has HUD and a classy interior. The vehicle is everything you'd expect in a luxury trim EV under $50K but it's a Nissan. My top of the line Platinum+ has a Bose Audio, Nappa leather, Seude inserts, active noise canellation, HUD, Ventillated seats and the self driving is a nice feature, but the follow-the-car-in-front-of you feature is the one I use every other day when stuck in traffic. I would have never thought it would, but it makes your commute so less stressful. There are downsides of course. The at home Level 2 charging is capped at 7.2 kw so the bigger 87kw/h battery takes a good 12+ hours to charge. The fast charging on paper looks bad (max 130kw) but as many have stated (and I found) it holds that maximum at even 50+% SOC. So I can fast charge 20-80 in about 35% so twice as slow as an Hyundai/Kia/Tesla. And of course, Nissan is viewed as a cheap car so you won't impress anyone at the country-club. A hidden benefit of the Ariya is that for any CPO version you can add a ""CPO Wrap"" for about $2K which gives you a very thorough (almost) bumper-to-bumper warranty for $2k for 7y/100k miles. Given all the electronics in these things (even the steering column is electronic) it should pay for itself. Anyway, go ahead and ask questions!",Rebel,Tesla,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1h5r31f/i_test_drove_every_trim_of_the_nissan_ariya_2023/
"Investing in humanoid robots and following Chris Camillo‚Äôs strategy is likely a road to failure. Time and time again, investors have been burned by trying to pick big winners and by overcomplicating a strategy that can be made very simple. I think this is about to happen to Chris Camillo if he strays from his main strategy and tries blending his self labeled ‚Äòsocial arbitrage‚Äô strategy with this idea of chasing the big humanoid robot investment. When personal vehicles powered by combustion first hit the market, people really underestimated just how ubiquitous cars would become. Yet, between 1890 and 1930, if you invested in a car company, you almost certainly went broke. In the U.S. alone, there were over 2,000 auto companies founded between 1890 and 1930. Basically all of which are now defunct other than maybe a handful. Studebaker was the household name, and ‚Äòsafest‚Äô car maker investment set to benefit from this revolution. Investors in Studebaker lost it all. Then came TVs. And it was the same story. Not a single American TV maker was a winning investment, even though every single household in the world has a tv. This time is not different. Then cell phones and the internet. Almost all of the companies that looked like big winners with big brand recognition proved to be poor investments in this time. Even Intel, which was believed to be the ‚Äòpicks and shovels‚Äô investment of the internet boom, ended up being a losing investment. ‚ÄòIntel Inside‚Äô was a brand that every single person in the world knew and trusted BEFORE the internet and computer age really took off, but people didn‚Äôt see AMD traversing Intel‚Äôs moat so easily. Tech bros believed that no matter which internet company succeeded, they would do so using Intel. Buffett was one of the ONLY major investors to come out of the internet boom a winner. While everyone lost their shirts in 2000-2001, Buffett crushed it. You might look back and think investments like Google were such obvious winners in 2004. Everyone was using them! Yet, if you bought Domino‚Äôs Pizza in 2004 instead of Google, your returns would have been better for the next 20 years. It is a dangerous game trying to pick winners, even when you‚Äôre right. For over 100 years, value has proven to consistently be the best strategy. Yet, Chris Camillo(and many others) are now constantly posting about investing in humanoid robot companies. Specifically Tesla for its Optimus tech. This is almost certainly going to lead to underperformance. There are countless startups doing this and Tesla‚Äôs moat is likely not as strong as it appears. Even though humanoid robots may change the world, trying to pick the company that will be the best investment will be a huge gamble, All that being said, I gave Camillo‚Äôs book a read yesterday and I listened to a couple podcast episodes he‚Äôs appeared on. His bread and butter is a form of very simple value investing, he just doesn‚Äôt brand it that way. His main strategy requires 3 basic metrics: 1 - Be extremely confident in the consumer behaviour of a very simple business. 2 - Invest early. 3 - Invest heavy. Number 1 is really a Buffett principle. Invest in something that is super simple, and easy to understand. If you can see that there‚Äôs an obvious high demand for something and you are extremely confident in your thesis, go for it. Number 2 is about paying a cheap price. If you know the economics of a business are currently booming(or about to), but the price hasn‚Äôt reflected it, obviously it‚Äôs a good deal. This means NVDA, CVNA, PLTR etc‚Ä¶ are probably no longer holdings of Chris Camillo‚Äôs. Number 3 is also a Buffett principle. Diversity is only protection against ignorance. The higher your conviction, the more concentrated you should be. I think Camillo‚Äôs strategy of gathering data from social media trends is actually quite brilliant and could potentially save value investors from being TOO early. Value investors tend to jump on price drops when they know the economics are likely return",Rebel,Tesla,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ld7kui/investing_in_humanoid_robots_and_following_chris/

"It‚Äôs a great question, Adam. Our Credo has been a guiding light for our entire organization for the past 75 years. Through periods of immense change, it clearly conveyed a set of values that influenced not only what we needed to achieve, but also the actions we needed to take to reach those achievements. At the same time, Our Credo is a living and breathing document. It‚Äôs both timely and timeless. Several times over the years, we‚Äôve revised it slightly to ensure it remains just as forward-thinking as the day it was introduced. For example, in 1979, wording was added to outline the company‚Äôs responsibility to ‚Äúprotecting the environment and natural resources,‚Äù which reflected larger changes in the world at that time, including growing awareness about the environment . Our Credo displayed at Johnson & Johnson‚Äôs New Brunswick, New Jersey, headquarters In 1987, the last time changes were made, the word ‚Äúfathers‚Äù was added to accompany ‚Äúmothers‚Äù in the first paragraph, and a nod to work/life balance was included with the addition of this sentence: ‚ÄúWe must be mindful of ways to help our employees fulfill their family responsibilities.‚Äù These updates were a recognition of changes in society and the workforce‚Äîmore and more women were working , and there was a rise in two-career families. Each time Our Credo has been updated, it has reflected the changing world in which we live and operate. What‚Äôs never changed, though, is the role it plays in guiding our company decisions at every level, and that‚Äôs an important distinction‚Äîthis is not a decision that was made solely at the leadership level. Last year, we enlisted our Executive Committee members to host small focus groups with over 2,000 employees across all of our regions, functions, levels and sectors. During these conversations we asked them: What does Our Credo mean to you? How can we make sure it‚Äôs relevant not just for today, but also tomorrow? We invited these employees to suggest any changes they felt would better reflect the times we live in to ensure Our Credo‚Äôs future impact as a guiding document. After these small-group conversations, we came back together as an executive team to review the employee feedback, and after thoughtful debate and discussion, I believe that the time is right to update Our Credo to reflect the needs of a new world, and solidify our commitments to the health of humanity over the long term.",Caregiver,Johnson & Johnson,google_cse,https://www.jnj.com/latest-news/johnson-johnson-ceo-alex-gorsky-reflects-on-the-power-of-the-companys-credo

"A few weeks ago, I had the unique privilege of traveling to Africa to meet with Johnson & Johnson employees, government officials and other stakeholders in Accra, Ghana, and Johannesburg, South Africa. While I travel frequently, it is always a great experience to see the work of our international employees and partners firsthand, and to see our company Credo in action. My visit to one of those partners, the Medical & Surgical Skills Institute (MSSI) in Ghana, was one of the highlights of my trip. Participants in a suturing class in Ghana According to data from Vanderbilt University Medical Center, 5 billion people ‚Äîparticularly in low-income and lower-middle-income countries‚Äîlack access to safe, affordable surgical and anesthesia care. And while Ghana , on average, does better than most countries in making surgery available to people who need it, it‚Äôs always crucial to keep training new health workers to help maintain the skills of people working in surgical settings. In fact, ensuring that more people around the world have access to essential surgical care is a major component of Johnson & Johnson‚Äôs commitment to the 2030 UN Sustainable Development Goals . To date, more than 10,500 healthcare providers have received critical skills training from MSSI, which gets supplies and funding from Johnson & Johnson.

"My friend keeps talking about this girl he met online. Something seems odd My childhood friend, whom I‚Äôve known since we were three years old, has had trouble organizing his life since the pandemic. After some setbacks, he managed to get back on track and started studying while working with his father. He told me he met a girl online while playing ""Plato"" (a game), and I didn‚Äôt think much of it because he always made virtual friends. I stopped talking to him regularly for about three months due to my routine. When we resumed our conversations, he began to tell me more about this girl. At first, I was very receptive and believed him. This girl is from abroad (the USA). She skipped a few years of high school due to her intelligence. She speaks five languages. She graduated with the second-best GPA in oncology medicine from Harvard. She joined UNICEF and went on many missions around the world. All of this while being only 22 years old. She has a very rare blood type (Rh null), commonly known as golden blood. People with this blood type are at high risk during surgeries, which led to almost all of her family members passing away. She moved to our city for a supposed job opportunity and because she had been talking to him for a long time. I didn‚Äôt believe any of this story, but he spoke with incredible confidence and sounded frantic. Every time I questioned whether he was joking, he assured me he wasn‚Äôt. It turns out she had COVID recently, which triggered a heart problem, so she‚Äôs been confined to her home because she needs transfusions for some reason. My friend stopped going to work and studying, and even quit college. He distanced himself from everyone and rarely responds to messages. When he does, it‚Äôs to talk about her, his supposed girlfriend he met online. He says that he needs to talk to her all the time because, due to her condition, she is in danger of having a heart attack or something. Over time, he started saying stranger things, like that she was being harassed by people from the Plato community. These people would make fake screenshots showing him being unfaithful, and she chose to believe them. She made him believe that she had abandoned her lifelong friends because they were against him. He even mentioned that she claims to have some sort of power to predict deaths. He describes her as if she were a kind of genius or messiah. Once, I invited him to play Plato, and he agreed. I managed to talk to the girl via call and realized that he was indeed talking to another person. She didn‚Äôt seem brilliant at all. In fact, I suggested testing my level in one of the languages she supposedly speaks, and she pretended to lose the connection. My friend even changed his phone number because he believes her wealthy Russian ex-boyfriend will track him down. He also mentioned that she knows how to hack phone numbers and access bank accounts.

"We don‚Äôt pay taxes like Europe and don‚Äôt get services like Africa While posts like these spread misinformation, and still get upvoted 530 times, I know I might get downvoted here but I‚Äôll still go ahead with this post. Most people here believe the opposite to be true, sharing some facts to break the myth(s).This is not to say that we shouldn‚Äôt demand better services especially our crumbling urban infrastructure but posts on this group just speak about how everything is falling apart in our country and things are just getting worse. While I agree the taxation on automobile (43% Tax + Cess), Insurance and EMI are actual pain points for an average Indian and should be reduced for vehicles and eliminated for Insurance and EMI. But by no means are we paying anything close to what Europeans pay in taxes. Let‚Äôs compare Germany with India as it has the highest Population in Europe Population (Cr): 8.5 Vs 144 Per Capita Income (USD): ~50k Vs ~2.9k Tax Payers (in Cr): 4.2 Vs 9.3 Working Population (in Cr): 4.6 Vs 97.0 Taxpayer % of Working population: 90%+ Vs ~9% Top 8% by Income: 6k Euro (5.5L INR) Vs 90k INR (According to World Inequality Database) Tax Paid by top 8%: 25% to 42% (vary for different Tax class) Vs 5% Is the India middle class really paying high taxes? Well according to different survey an India middle class is defined as someone earning between 6-18LPA you‚Äôre paying 12% tax on 18LPA. And you‚Äôre in top 3% if you make more than 25LPA and even then you pay close to 17-18% taxes. Anyone who pays close to 25% income tax, they need to earn close to 55LPA putting them easily in top 1% in India, and I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs Tax terrorism by any means. We are a low GDP per capita country with close to bottom 65% households earning less than 5LPA (most of them are not on reddit) Now let‚Äôs come to the services like Africa part. Excluding SA as most when they speak about Services like Africa, don‚Äôt look at South Africa.

The U.S. Foreign Assistance website describes $51.4 million being given to the project over five years ending in January 2025, listing the partner as the Baylor College of Medicine. It is possible that Sentebale was not the only recipient.

In Botswana, we started the first year of the DREAMS programme with funding from USAID‚Äôs PEPFAR programme.

"Timber creeps me out more and more every episode. I hope I'm wrong. First of all, he's got mad skills, and seems like a law-abiding pleasant enough man, and I'm sure that he'd be a great guy to have as a neighbor. I don't doubt that he will win. And I know he follows this feed, so maybe he can shed some light. But what's all this talk about being some kind of non-specific international humanitarian aid worker, and bringing his family to his job sites in the bush. And in this episode also having to keep secret about his work. It's been a while, but I'm returned Peace Corps, and for years worked for/with orgs includiing USAID, CARE Int., M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res, UNICEF and others. Staff that brought famlies, lived in the big cities, not the bush. And staff have defined skill sets such as education, agriculture, health care, or even administration. And also, there are no secrets in reputable NGOs, b/c you want the objective of the project to be beyond reproach. Ask anyone in the field, and they will openly tell you the specific objectives, geographic areas, demographics, timeline and funding like it's second nature. So i'm guessing missionary, with maybe extreme proselytizing. And it's the wild west out there with no rules. Any church can raise 30K and send someone to the bush to give ""aid."" And while World Vision is bad enough, in my work I've encountered just scores of missionaries, with religious fanatics, that did a lot more harm than good. For example: Schools that require two or more hours of daily religious indoctrination at the cost of the ABC's,, teaching that condoms are a sin in areas of extreme poverty where maybe half the girls make money through prostitution, teaching that it's God's will that girls should have as many children as possible, trading food for baptisms, warning against vaccinations or medical care b/c it's against God's will....etc. And also **proselytizing in countries where it's illegal.** All in the name of humanitarian ""aid."" In these cases the job-title missionary is much more appropriate than humanitarian aid worker. Moreover, these groups not only harm the direct recipients of the ""aid"" but also sincere aid groups, by tarnishing the reputations of aid efforts as a whole. And as far as the the ""aid"" worker themselves, half the time they love being in the bush, because it brings privilege and status to an otherwise very ordinary life, simply b/c you are a Westerner with some money. Remember, to a starving child, a man with a loaf of bread is a god. Timber: There's a picture of you with kids in the mountains of Afganistan. If the Taliban were to learn that you were there, are those kids and that village in danger from your ""aid?"" Maybe I'm totally wrong on this, and honestly I'd like to be wrong. So, please let me know cuz I'd like to cheer for you to win. Edit: Post script, rereading I realize I'm somewhat harsh on FBOs. In fact many of the FBO's have done great work. But generally those people will be open about it. Mormons, Adventists, and many groups will state that they are on mission, and then I'll ask if they want to get a beer to test their faith :-) It's the ones that are not open that are scary. Cuz the only closed off aid workers i've met are either missionaries or spooks, and I just can't see Timber as a CIA agent. Post-Post Script: After reading the comments I want to say that I am NOT attacking Timber's faith, or religion as a whole, or even Timber's overall character. I know that the TV show edits what they want us to see. I'm more concerned with the distinction of what is an International Humanitarian Aid worker, and whether that title is disingenuous. If Timber is a missionary, I respect that as long as his actions are legal and **secularly** ethical. However, from what I've learned about his work near the Afgan border, if the local governments knew of his purpose in translating the local languages is to print bibles, and that his group is smuggling Afgani's out of the country, th",Caregiver,UNICEF,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alonetv/comments/1etipk7/timber_creeps_me_out_more_and_more_every_episode/

"I think it's high time we considered a REAL Zombie FPS game... I won't beat around the bush: I fucking love zombies. FUCKING LOVE THEM. I had considered posting this under r/zombies, but I didn't think it would get the serious consideration it deserved. I've played *Dead Rising*, *Left4Dead*, even schooled kids in *House of the Dead* arcade machines. I""ve seen just about every zombie movie out there, watched AMC's *The Walking Dead* religiously and read Max Brooks' *World War Z* and *The Zombie Survival Guide* (in addition to the million or so other novel/novellas/graphic novels that exist). But IMO, there's still not a FPS that measures up to what fans of the genre expect. COD has already touched on zombies a little bit with World at War and Black Ops, and as much fun as it is, I wonder if a full-length-feature game centered around Z-Day couldn't be successful. Imagine if you will, the military scenarios that would present themselves if a Z-Day actually happened: I see battalion blockades in NYC, soldiers cornered, pinned down, forced to fight seemingly unending waves of zombies. The lines break, you and your team run, fighting through buildings, the streets, trying to get out of the city as the lines fall one by one. Maybe another perpective from another country in the campaign: A soldier in the Chinese Army stationed in a small village in rural China near the mountains. A strange sickness starts to spread, and pretty soon this small mostly farming community is overrun with the walking dead. You have to fight your way down to the river, steal a fishing boat, and get the hell out of dodge. There are so many possibilities: 7 continents worth of playable maps/situations that would be under attack in different ways/scenarios. I've noticed a lot of the Battlefield and COD franchise is centered in the Middle East (and a lot of people seem to either love it or are wishing for a change of scenery). What if the beginning of the campaign has you starting out as a soldier in war-torn Afghanistan or Iraq on a mission babysitting UNICEF workers as they help civilians injured in bomb strikes, landmine accidents, and military skirmishes? A young boy is brought in with a strange rash and labored breathing. You're stationed outside the tent with a couple of other soldiers (or mercs) when suddenly screaming erupts from inside the tent. The soldiers turn to see blossoms of blood bloom against the tent walls. You rush inside to find everyone inside is either dying, being eaten alive, or in the process of becoming a zombie. Your team tries to fight them off, but to no avail. You fall back to the outskirts of the Relief Zone but your ammo is low. It's down to just you and your buddy, back to back with your pistol, fighting off the town as they succumb to the chaos and seek you out, eager to eat your flesh. Eventually you are overrun; the first zombie bites into your arm, you knife him. The second knocks you down, the gun falling just out of reach. They're on you in seconds, biting, tearing, pulling you apart, eating you alive. The screen bleeds red and then blackness. You have just become the first casualties of World War Z. Cue opening credits... I think this would have people playing the campaign over and over again. You would be hard pressed to find someone not buying a FPS these days solely for the online competition, and campaigns have kind of fallen by the wayside (they're usually used as a learning device to get the player familiar with strategy and button configuration). If you had a successful, engaging game about fighting through the zombie apocalypse from the perspectives of people all over the world (with multiple expansion packs that could be released) I think people would play the SHIT out of it. And don't forget multiplayer, that oh-so-holy-grail of internet gameplay. COD: Black Ops gave us the option of bots this time around. I propose another option: zombies.

My childhood friend, whom I‚Äôve known since we were three years old, has had trouble organizing his life since the pandemic. After some setbacks, he managed to get back on track and started studying while working with his father. He told me he met a girl online while playing ""Plato"" (a game), and I didn‚Äôt think much of it because he always made virtual friends. I stopped talking to him regularly for about three months due to my routine. When we resumed our conversations, he began to tell me more about this girl. At first, I was very receptive and believed him. This girl is from abroad (the USA). She skipped a few years of high school due to her intelligence. She speaks five languages. She graduated with the second-best GPA in oncology medicine from Harvard. She joined UNICEF and went on many missions around the world. All of this while being only 22 years old. She has a very rare blood type (Rh null), commonly known as golden blood. People with this blood type are at high risk during surgeries, which led to almost all of her family members passing away. She moved to our city for a supposed job opportunity and because she had been talking to him for a long time. I didn‚Äôt believe any of this story, but he spoke with incredible confidence and sounded frantic. Every time I questioned whether he was joking, he assured me he wasn‚Äôt. It turns out she had COVID recently, which triggered a heart problem, so she‚Äôs been confined to her home because she needs transfusions for some reason. My friend stopped going to work and studying, and even quit college. He distanced himself from everyone and rarely responds to messages. When he does, it‚Äôs to talk about her, his supposed girlfriend he met online. He says that he needs to talk to her all the time because, due to her condition, she is in danger of having a heart attack or something. Over time, he started saying stranger things, like that she was being harassed by people from the Plato community. These people would make fake screenshots showing him being unfaithful, and she chose to believe them. She made him believe that she had abandoned her lifelong friends because they were against him. He even mentioned that she claims to have some sort of power to predict deaths. He describes her as if she were a kind of genius or messiah. Once, I invited him to play Plato, and he agreed. I managed to talk to the girl via call and realized that he was indeed talking to another person. She didn‚Äôt seem brilliant at all. In fact, I suggested testing my level in one of the languages she supposedly speaks, and she pretended to lose the connection. My friend even changed his phone number because he believes her wealthy Russian ex-boyfriend will track him down. He also mentioned that she knows how to hack phone numbers and access bank accounts. He told a very macabre story about a murder of one of her family members that chilled me to the bone. He says that he met this girl and that they made out. They both told me in the call I mentioned before that they met each other in person. Something seems very odd. I‚Äôm losing my friend, and I don‚Äôt know what to do.

"Regarding Kakuma Camp Hey everyone! As you may be aware, there has been a group of people from Kakuma on our subreddits, and we've recently been made aware that multiple users from this subreddit (as well as other LGBT related subreddits) have been approached by people asking for donations to this ""group"" through private or direct messages. They are almost always new accounts with low karma and generic usernames claiming to be affiliated with the Kakuma refugee camp. We've been keeping track of this group for a while, and while we cannot be 100% sure on this matter, we have a growing suspicion that the people behind this campaign are trying to scam money out of us and our users. We've done some personal research into the matter by reaching out to people who do missionary related things in the area, to groups within the area, and other things as well, however we cannot connect them to these accounts, the crowd-funders, or anything else that they post. When they have made posts, when someone points out that they tend to look like a scam, they then delete their account, and any related information related to that account. Now, as we've said, there is a chance that this is not a scam, however our subreddit does not allow fundraising on it, for a number of reasons; such as not being able to 100% verify any user, the potential that donating could link your account to any personal information given, as well as it just not being a safe thing to do on the internet unless you know the organization or person running it very well. Our community is one that is often stricken by poverty itself, so we understand the want to help out the refugees there. We ask that you keep safe and act smart, that you don't donate to people you don't know, and that you keep your personal information secure.

"The U.S. renew support for UNICEF‚Äôs mission to protect children in Libya The Embassy of the United States of America in Libya renewed the U.S. support for UNICEF‚Äôs mission to protect children in Libya. According to the note, published by the Embassy official website, Ambassador Richard Norland and UNICEF‚Äôs new Special Representative for Libya Abdulkadir Musse had an introductory call on Monday to discuss UNICEF‚Äôs important work in Libya. The meeting covered a wide range of issues facing children‚Äôs health and safety in Libya including vaccine shortages, safety of children migrants, monitoring and reporting on child soldiers, and Covid-19 response efforts. Ambassador Norland re-affirmed U.S. support for UNICEF‚Äôs efforts in the context of progress in Libya‚Äôs political dialogue and the reduction of violence following Libyan-led talks including the October 23 cease-fire declaration. The situation in Libya remained volatile throughout the 2020 with a conflict of variable intensity that continued to put the lives of civilians at risk and to generate new internal displacement. According to the UN body, in the Western Libya, deterioration of services and rapidly declining economy resulting in increased suffering of millions of children and their families in Libya that cannot be underscored. Since the start of the year, at least 18 schools have been damaged as a result of the armed conflict, affecting around 15,890 children. Continuous attacks on the water system have jeopardized health and hygiene among the civilian population, particularly those most vulnerable. At least 127 wells have been rendered out of services as a result of these attacks, with roughly a loss of 650,000 m3 water/day. Regular long hours‚Äô power cuts have further affected the people of Libya in areas of active conflict and surrounding areas. In April and May 2020, the aggressive offensive by the Government of National Accord (GNA) militias to control Tripoli and western areas saw the Libyan National Army (LNA) withdrawing from the frontlines and as a result, approximately 28,000 people (5,550 families) including 11,000 children were displaced from Tarhouna, one of the strongholds of the LNA, with majority of them displaced to Benghazi, Ejdabia, and Bani Walid. Most of the IDPs moved with family members or rented houses, however, the authorities converted nine schools into IDP shelter centres to accommodate the IDPs from Tarhouna. Similarly, to accommodate the IDPs from Tarhouna, an additional nine schools were converted into IDP shelters in June 2020, thus, bringing the total number of schools used as IDP shelter centres to 345. The UN also reported of continuous violations of international humanitarian law after the withdrawal of the LNA from Tarhouna, where over 100 bodies including women and children were found in a hospital in Tarhouna. In addition, a large number of unidentified bodies were discovered in 11 mass graves in Tarhouna. The GNA, UNSMIL and UN Secretary-General condemned the discovery of these mass graves and urged for a prompt and transparent investigations by commissioning a ‚Äòfact-finding mission‚Äô by the UN Human Rights Council. The withdrawal of the armed groups from the Western Libya brought about a grotesque turn. Land mines, Improvised Explosive Devices (IED), and explosive remnants of war (ERW) have been found in and around civilian houses in Tripoli and western areas, putting populations on the move, especially IDPs and returnees, at significant risk. During May 22 to June 22, 2020, the Libyan Centre for Mine Action and War Remnants recorded a total of 127 victims from mine explosions in Tripoli and around Sirte, including 55 members of mine-clearing teams who were killed and injured during demining. On 28 May, UNICEF, together with the UNMAS and the LibMAC, condemned the use of IED/booby traps against civilians and their impact on children.

"Alec¬¥s donations, PR or pay to play To distract me from the horrible fires in Spain and the crass exploitation of Carmen, I decided to dig through the Baldwin¬¥s charitable donations. It¬¥s taken me a few hours but I am finally done. Unfortunately, every time I try to post a pic of each of the 18 years, my post is deleted by Reddit. So here is only the summary and a couple more. All of this is available online through ProPublica. I have to admit I am impressed by Alec¬¥s charity. I think it¬¥s nice to give. I have to give him that. However, with that said, it is pretty obvious that some of Alec¬¥s giving is paying to play. He has given a lot of money to the East Hampton Library and that helps to explain Hilaria¬¥s presence and interview about her BS book. Their prime seats at US Tennis, well, he donates to the USTA, also the the NY Philharmonic, where he has a hosting gig. I am sure that some of the children¬¥s visits to the Museum were facilitated by their parent¬¥s donations. He gives money to his kid¬¥s school and I suspect that St. Monica might be the church that his daughter attended in LA. Some of the giving is for PR after all his bad behavior, like the 2018 arrest for assault. He also gave a lot more money during his 30 Rock Years and it is understand that he gave ALL of the money he received from the Capital One ads (nearly $15 million) to charity. What is pretty obvious is that either Alec¬¥s finances are strained or he has decided to spend more of his money on his familia. His donations have taken a steep dive after Griftmas and the onslaught of baby after baby. I have highlighted a few obvious donations but maybe you will find some interesting nuggets. I also pulled his 2024 and 2025 donations from his Foundation¬¥s FB page. Another pepino provided an earlier report on Alec¬¥s 2022 return (link below). I wanted to start from the beginning through today to get an idea of what he has done.

"My friend keeps talking about this girl he met online. Something seems odd. My friend keeps talking about this girl he met online. Something seems odd. My childhood friend, whom I‚Äôve known since we were three years old, has had trouble organizing his life since the pandemic. After some setbacks, he managed to get back on track and started studying while working with his father. He told me he met a girl online while playing ""Plato"" (a game), and I didn‚Äôt think much of it because he always made virtual friends. I stopped talking to him regularly for about three months due to my routine. When we resumed our conversations, he began to tell me more about this girl. At first, I was very receptive and believed him. This girl is from abroad (the USA). She skipped a few years of high school due to her intelligence. She speaks five languages. She graduated with the second-best GPA in oncology medicine from Harvard. She joined UNICEF and went on many missions around the world. All of this while being only 22 years old. She has a very rare blood type (Rh null), commonly known as golden blood. People with this blood type are at high risk during surgeries, which led to almost all of her family members passing away. She moved to our city for a supposed job opportunity and because she had been talking to him for a long time. I didn‚Äôt believe any of this story, but he spoke with incredible confidence and sounded frantic. Every time I questioned whether he was joking, he assured me he wasn‚Äôt. It turns out she had COVID recently, which triggered a heart problem, so she‚Äôs been confined to her home because she needs transfusions for some reason. My friend stopped going to work and studying, and even quit college. He distanced himself from everyone and rarely responds to messages. When he does, it‚Äôs to talk about her, his supposed girlfriend he met online. He says that he needs to talk to her all the time because, due to her condition, she is in danger of having a heart attack or something. Over time, he started saying stranger things, like that she was being harassed by people from the Plato community. These people would make fake screenshots showing him being unfaithful, and she chose to believe them. She made him believe that she had abandoned her lifelong friends because they were against him. He even mentioned that she claims to have some sort of power to predict deaths. He describes her as if she were a kind of genius or messiah. Once, I invited him to play Plato, and he agreed. I managed to talk to the girl via call and realized that he was indeed talking to another person. She didn‚Äôt seem brilliant at all. In fact, I suggested testing my level in one of the languages she supposedly speaks, and she pretended to lose the connection. My friend even changed his phone number because he believes her wealthy Russian ex-boyfriend will track him down. He also mentioned that she knows how to hack phone numbers and access bank accounts. He told a very macabre story about a murder of one of her family members that chilled me to the bone. He says that he met this girl and that they made out. They both told me in the call I mentioned before that they met each other in person. Something seems very odd. I‚Äôm losing my friend, and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm unsure if they want to take money from him or something worse. I don‚Äôt want to oppose him for fear that he might shut me out and stop talking to me. My friend was never a liar. I have known him since I was a child. Im doubting everything. I dont know if shes lying, if my friend is lying to me for some reason. I dont know what else to do to help my friend. What should I do?

"The tales of Russian ‚Äúchild robbers‚Äù **The US has evacuated thousands of children in every war, from Vietnam to Afghanistan, declaring it a humanitarian mission. When Russia brings orphans from combat zones in Ukraine, an overwhelming Western propaganda apparatus portrays this as child abduction and a crime.** In April 1975, as the Vietnam War drew to a close, the US military transported several thousand children from Vietnam to the United States in Operation Babylift, according to official figures. The transport made headlines at the time because the first plane carrying Vietnamese children crashed near Saigon. Almost half a century later, in December 2021, CNN reported that the US military had brought 1,450 children from Afghanistan to the United States. A report that generated no more political attention than a traffic jam report or the weather forecast. I don't know how many children the US has transported in all its wars: from Latin America, Asia, and Africa, from the Balkans, Iraq, Libya, or Syria. According to media reports, more than 50,000 were transported in the Vietnam War alone, and there, as in other cases, many pious and less pious Christian aid organizations were involved. Not a single journalist from a major Western newspaper ever thought of referring to all these transports as ""child abduction"" or ""deportations."" Quite the opposite. The protection of the defenseless has always been a precept of international humanitarian law. The Geneva Conventions regulate the protection of civilians, including children, in war. But this does not apply to Russia. When the Russian army evacuates parentless children and young people from Ukrainian combat zones, this cannot be considered a humanitarian action, because Russia, in the person of Putin, is devoid of any humanity and compassion. This twisted logic is clearly the basis of the propaganda fictions fabricated by numerous human rights NGOs and circulated in major Western media outlets since the beginning of the war. Most of these NGOs are not what their name suggests - namely, they are independent of government funding and pressure groups. Many are engaged in regime change where the West intends it. And this is becoming increasingly difficult to conceal. India has revoked the licenses of 15,000 (fifteen thousand) non-governmental organizations in recent years. The Russian government's detailed statements on the allegations of child abduction are either ignored by the major Western media outlets or condensed into two or three sentences, usually under the buzzword ""Moscow is denying it again."" Russia is largely powerless against a massive Western propaganda machine that is pushing for military buildup and conjuring up a war against Russia. **‚ÄúPutin the Child Catcher‚Äù** No sophisticated propaganda techniques were needed to fabricate the narrative about the ""deportation of Ukrainian children."" The issue is simple. Children evacuated by Russian troops from danger zones on the front lines are usually registered as residents in Ukraine. As soon as a territory is occupied by Russian troops, children in that zone can be listed as ""disappeared"" and declared ""displaced persons."" There are apparently no limits to narrative creativity when it comes to ""Putin the child catcher"" ([NZZ](https://www.nzz.ch/gesellschaft/russland-verschleppte-gezielt-ukrainische-kinder-ld.1778113)). Mykola Kuleba, government commissioner for children's rights in Kyiv, told the UN Security Council: ""More than a million children have ended up in the occupied territories of Crimea and Donbas and were deported to Moscow. They were stolen and turned into weapons. Thousands of them are now fighting against their homeland."" The idea that the Russian government is kidnapping children from Ukraine to ""Russify"" them in educational camps, ""erasing their identity,"" and then sending them to the front as cannon fodder is constantly [circulating](https://globalchildren.georgetown.edu/posts/russia-is-turning-abducted-ukrai",Caregiver,UNICEF,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stupidpol/comments/1my2580/the_tales_of_russian_child_robbers/
"The next moonshot? I called Abble ($AABL) just a week before it pumped, now I'm calling Pawthereum ($PAWTH) | $480,000 donated to animal charities | Fully audited and KYCed I have the receipts to prove my crypto success. Check my post history and read the post titled ‚ÄúMoonshot Magic: 13 Keys to Meme Coin Success.‚Äù In that post I praised Abble for their community and for being a potential leader of the stock meta for meme coins. I predicted it would skyrocket, and a week later, its price shot up by over 1,600%. If you invested just $600 when I said to, you‚Äôd have an easy $10,000 now. I‚Äôm not here to flex - just saying I‚Äôve got a proven track record for spotting winners. After breaking down my 13 Keys to Meme Coin Success (which I used to call Abble‚Äôs run), I‚Äôm now seeing similar indicators for Pawthereum ($PAWTH). This project combines the viral appeal of cat tokens with a strong foundation, and there‚Äôs real momentum building in its community. Plus, with renewed interest in animal-themed projects, the timing feels perfect. Pawthereum is also adapting to emerging crypto metas, recently launching a tokenized AI agent to help raise capital for their philanthropic efforts. Their adaptability to the crypto landscape is impressive. \*\*Why Pawthereum?\*\* Pawthereum‚Äôs doing incredible things that are still flying under the radar. Once more people realize their achievements, the cat‚Äôs out of the bag. A Pawthereum community member recently went to Geneva to join UNICEF on a panel to discuss crypto philanthropy and blockchain as a force for good. Many of the same patterns that triggered Abble‚Äôs success are showing up here. Strong ‚Äúcat coin‚Äù vibes have worked well for other projects like POPCAT. \*\*Here's why Pawthereum has potential to be a leader of the upcoming cat coin meta:\*\* 1. Community-Driven: PAWTH‚Äôs community is passionate, growing, and already has made headlines in the previous bull run for their charitable efforts. 2. Charity-Focused: It's not just about profits here, folks. Pawthereum donates to animal shelters and rescues, giving it an actual use case that resonates with people. 3. Memetic Power: Cats have been meme lords since the dawn of memes. Just imagine the viral potential when people catch on to the narrative shift from dog to cat coins. 4. Cat Takeover: With all the major meme coin categories covered, the market is begging for something fresh. Cat coins are it. Look at the success of other animal-themed tokens. Now multiply that with the cultural dominance of cats. What is Pawthereum? Pawthereum is a cryptocurrency project with animal welfare at its core, with a mission to support animal shelters and be a digital advocate for animals in need. All too often, smaller animal shelters struggle financially, often overlooked and overshadowed by larger charitable organizations. Pawthereum was created to address this, aiming to become the leading disruptor of charitable inclusion by utilizing the advantages of blockchain technology to obtain funding, bypass the middleman, and donate directly to animal shelters around the world. This team has managed to donate around $480,000 to different charities and shelters, including the largest cryptocurrency donation ever made in Scotland‚Äôs history: $118,000 donated to Edinburgh Dog and Cat Home. A $100,000 donation was given to PAWS Wildlife Center, an amazing sanctuary, hospital, and rehabilitation center in Washington State, USA. A $50,000 donation to the Catherine Violet Hubbard Animal Sanctuary and many others! Pawthereum has already made a difference for many other shelters around the world: [https://pawthereum.com/charity-donations/](https://pawthereum.com/charity-donations/) Pawthereum is my next pick, but keep an eye on Abble too - it‚Äôs not done yet.

"My friend keeps talking about this girl he met online. Something seems odd. My childhood friend, whom I‚Äôve known since we were three years old, has had trouble organizing his life since the pandemic. After some setbacks, he managed to get back on track and started studying while working with his father. He told me he met a girl online while playing ""Plato"" (a game), and I didn‚Äôt think much of it because he always made virtual friends. I stopped talking to him regularly for about three months due to my routine. When we resumed our conversations, he began to tell me more about this girl. At first, I was very receptive and believed him. This girl is from abroad (the USA). She skipped a few years of high school due to her intelligence. She speaks five languages. She graduated with the second-best GPA in oncology medicine from Harvard. She joined UNICEF and went on many missions around the world. All of this while being only 22 years old. She has a very rare blood type (Rh null), commonly known as golden blood. People with this blood type are at high risk during surgeries, which led to almost all of her family members passing away. She moved to our city for a supposed job opportunity and because she had been talking to him for a long time. I didn‚Äôt believe any of this story, but he spoke with incredible confidence and sounded frantic. Every time I questioned whether he was joking, he assured me he wasn‚Äôt. It turns out she had COVID recently, which triggered a heart problem, so she‚Äôs been confined to her home because she needs transfusions for some reason. My friend stopped going to work and studying, and even quit college. He distanced himself from everyone and rarely responds to messages. When he does, it‚Äôs to talk about her, his supposed girlfriend he met online. He says that he needs to talk to her all the time because, due to her condition, she is in danger of having a heart attack or something. Over time, he started saying stranger things, like that she was being harassed by people from the Plato community. These people would make fake screenshots showing him being unfaithful, and she chose to believe them. She made him believe that she had abandoned her lifelong friends because they were against him. He even mentioned that she claims to have some sort of power to predict deaths. He describes her as if she were a kind of genius or messiah. Once, I invited him to play Plato, and he agreed. I managed to talk to the girl via call and realized that he was indeed talking to another person. She didn‚Äôt seem brilliant at all. In fact, I suggested testing my level in one of the languages she supposedly speaks, and she pretended to lose the connection. My friend even changed his phone number because he believes her wealthy Russian ex-boyfriend will track him down. He also mentioned that she knows how to hack phone numbers and access bank accounts. He told a very macabre story about a murder of one of her family members that chilled me to the bone. He says that he met this girl and that they made out. They both told me in the call I mentioned before that they met each other in person. Something seems very odd. I‚Äôm losing my friend, and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm unsure if they want to take money from him or something worse. I don‚Äôt want to oppose him for fear that he might shut me out and stop talking to me. My friend was never a liar. I have known him since I was a child. Im doubting everything. I dont know if shes lying, if my friend is lying to me for some reason. I dont know what else to do to help my friend.

I literally had no conscious awareness of what I was doing until it was too late. But beyond those 5 seconds, I have not consumed any moving images in 2 days. I will allow myself to consume a moving image ONLY if required by my job. Will see how it goes.... Since there has been some interest in this, I thought I would update as I go along. Day 1 Aug 31 afternoon: Avert my eyes from multiple moving ads on MetroNorth, Grand Central, and the MTA. Sept 1: Watch about 5 seconds of an Instagram reel before suddenly realizing WTF I'm doing and shut it off 9/2: In the AM, I need to read a People magazine story for work. In the corner is a video (not an ad) that no matter what I do, I can't shut off. Forced to watch in the periphery of my vision while reading the article. Afternoon: Again went into an article and was forced to see about 2 seconds of a video in the corner of the article before I figured out how to turn it off. 9/3 - The hardest part by far is being an online participant and seeing moving images as I go to websites for work. They are even on sites (like my own) that did not used to have them. Even a Google search now brings up a video at the top of the search. So this has already happened a couple of times this morning. Each time, I quickly scroll past or avert my eyes. One of my browsers has an ad blocker on it, I will switch to that and see if it helps. As for long form moving images like movies or YouTube videos, the time I usually watch those is at night when I start cooking and then while I'm eating dinner. So now I cook to either silence or a podcast, and I eat while in silence or listening to a podcast. I can't read while eating as it is hard to turn the page. I have a foster kitten and use one hand to play with her. I find that the passive time I'd have my eyes glued to someone on my iPad is now better spent playing with her. 8:30 AM. I read something that made me think I should look it up on YouTube. I went to YT, and as all the video thumbnails loaded, I thought ""Holy shit, what am I doing?"" and closed out without watching a video. 10 seconds later: Clicked on a link that I thought would lead to an article but led to a TikTok video. Shut it off after a second or two. Need to switch to my browser with the ad/pop up blocker. Normally don't use it because it slows everything down, and I also miss things I need to see for my job. 8PM: Uploaded a story to Instagram for my cat foster account as my foster kitten went to her new home, watched it back and watched too far, someone else's story came on and it was moving! Sigh. 9/4 My foster kitten's new home sent me a video of her this morning. I of course clicked it and watched it several times and also sent it to some other people and posted it on Instagram, and am only now realizing (15 minutes later) that I watched moving images!! Sigh... But this is important stuff, seeing how my foster kitten of 3 months was doing in her brand new home. I know more videos will follow of her in her new home and how she is doing with her new resident cat friend. I don't know what to do exactly... 9/5 I've decided I will watch any text msg videos sent by my foster kitten's new home as those are more important than the experiment. I need to see how she is adjusting there and to watch her body language.

"DD: Gamestop Price Analysis -- still a Deep Fucking Value under $550 **TLDR;** Gamestop is undervalued considering its online sales numbers and ecommerce focus - analysts haven‚Äôt caught up yet from Q4 Earning report; add on top of that all the hiring of Amazon execs and VPs and Gamestop Valuation is about to explode upward. On its current trajectory $550-750 a share is a reasonable (my worthless opinion) price point, with or without the squeeze. Not only is buying GME a play on the squeeze, but also a deep fucking value bet. Fair warning, you'll develop a wrinkle of two if you proceed... but don‚Äôt worry my fellow ape brethren I‚Äôve included charts, with colors, to make visualization easy. Let‚Äôs walk through these figures one by one and tell the story of Gamestop‚Äôs transition. \*\*\*\*\*\*\* \*Edit\* also see latest update (4/1): [Our Whale is Suppressing Volatility to Bleed HFs -- Max Pain Explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mi1a5r/our_whale_is_suppressing_volatility_to_bleed_hfs/) # Chapter 1: Gamestop‚Äôs Advantage in its Transition to Online. Let‚Äôs start with the ugly before we get to the good stuff: **Operating Loss**. An operating loss occurs when a company's operating expenses exceed gross profits. Gamestop has had a fairly significant operating loss for many years now (peaking in 2018), as it faced the challenges all brick and mortar stores faced: theft of sales to the e-commerce giants -- the convenience of online downloads and pre-ordering on the internet. In the last two years, this loss has come down significantly. And what impresses me most about Gamestop is their cash on hand (currently $635M). Very few stores with operating losses have that level of cash. Most are in debt, and require the sale of shares to float by during rough times. &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/dyyd0zf7req61.png?width=1544&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3e553bc397243f7b97702eb68d52d1a462c1431 And this is the key misstep the HF‚Äôs made in shorting Gamestop. There has been a stigma out there about brick and mortar stores going under (Toys R Us, and Sears as example)... feeding frenzy, blood in the water you get the point. Sharks (HFs) have been getting more and more bold (reckless) in their targeting. Gamestop was the wrong target, for a very specific reason. It leases its stores. By comparison, consider Walmart needing to reduce stores, or Target. They‚Äôve built massive buildings with parking lots to house their very specific store needs (huge upfront costs, sunk), and they rent (or own) these buildings under much different contracts. They can‚Äôt easily get up and leave one of their stores. Ask yourself, how would Walmart leave a store? Who would buy it? How could the investor renting to them turn it into something else? Maybe a city might want it to build an expo center. On the cheap. WalMarts costs are priced into this (it‚Äôs expensive). They can‚Äôt move as easily. Point being, Gamestop doesn‚Äôt owe anything to shut down a store, it simply stops paying its lease and moves all it‚Äôs stuff out. They rent strip mall locations and mall storefronts. This allows them to liquidate stores and downsize with little to no sunk costs. They can also reposition themselves much more efficiently. This is why we see this fast turn-around in Operating Loss last year (a major component of Operating Loss is storefront costs for Brick and Mortar). News of Gamestop closing stores isn‚Äôt bad news. Remember that. The media will try to sell it as such. Because of the focus, Gamestop is eyeing Digital Sales, for its future. # Chapter 2: Digital Sales Growth It is clear to everyone, at this point, that Gamestop is looking to move a large portion of its business into the online space. In 2020 Gamestop did $580Million in sales online, and in Q4 alone their online sales represented over 34% of all Gamestop sales; Gamestop did more in online sales in the 4th quarter of 2020 than it did in all of 2019. &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/80l9ei8breq61.png?wid",Explorer,The North Face,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mhcmi4/dd_gamestop_price_analysis_still_a_deep_fucking/
"Elon Musk New Pay Package is the Inverse of what is institutional knowledge They just released his new 1 trillon dollar pay package that in order to hit would require certain targets. This is the only time that I've seen so many inverse things happen like this. * Giving a founder additional shares to do his job just to motivate him when the majority of his wealth is based on Tesla in the first place, Refreshers are normal and option plans are normal, but needing 1T worth of them is not. * They think that old Elon who used to captivate an audience through being progressive and promoting the future... will somehow return (not only has he lost steam for promising lofty ideas but people are finally tired of broken promises by him, every year its another almost there target for self driving. Also where is the new roadster?) * Everyone is tired of Elon standing on stage trying to compute how to speak as he jumps around and does salutes ""as a joke"" vs someone who sits back and builds out the company to its full potential * The company still caters to a a high end, well educated consumer for their products. As soon as he lost the base for it he did all the damage control he could. He literally tried to have Trump sell his cars on the Whitehouse green, that's how desperate its got for him crying on twitch (a gaming platform) about people hating him. * The board of directors is stacked in his favor but also is so fearful of him that they won't standup to him. They at least have enough of a spine to make sure he hits targets to get his package. Although he will never meet those goals so I guess if you are an Elon Supporter this is great news (your lord is staying around) if you are inbetween you know what you are getting and if you hate him, well he has a giant carrot Infront of him to do something. I think that the pay package is so strange as somehow he will recover the mess he created. If I joined a company (as Elon joined Tesla, he didn't create it) then got it to the position where he risked everything to make it the brand/success it is, then tanked it by his political/ketamine rants, then was offered 1T to act normal and bring it all back.... I'd be the luckiest person on earth. This story is bonkers. **I'd rather see they pay someone a 1 trillion dollar pay package to wipe Elon's image out of the Tesla picture or** associated with Elon. A rebrand to being progressive, for human rights, and a environmental company . This is the strangest pay package I've ever seen. The bottom line is, if they hired any reputable CEO that can re-establish the brand of being a modern, progressive company, they would be back on track, not trying to force this monstrosity back into its cage with money. Tesla in Europe, China, and even North America sales are steadily declining, tax credit offsets are ending, the company needs a new face, and Elon is the worst way to promote what was once the progressive movement. EDIT: To everyone saying that if they don't offer this up he'll leave and either start another competitor or destroy the brand. The issue is the brand is destroyed already by someone who tweets about illegal aliens and governement conspiracies all day and night. How has his ventures gone since he became the DOGE psychopath? XAi is a dumster fire of VC money, Boring Company has.... built a tunnel under vegas convention center that has human drivers for robo taxi's, sales have steadily declined, solar and battery have been taken over by other companies, uhhh what am I missing? Oh SpaceX.... if it wasn't for Gwynne Shotwell it would be a dumpster fire.

"$VFC : The North Face,Vans , Timberlands ## The Turnaround Story VF Corp is one of the world's largest footwear, apparel, and accessories companies. It owns a portfolio of highly iconic brands, including The North Face, Vans, Timberland and Supreme, brands that wouldn‚Äôt be unfamiliar to your average American. VF-Corp ## The Fall from Grace The stock has crashed 88% from its 2021 all-time high of $100 per share and is currently trading at $12 per share. What has changed,you may ask ? The sell-off can be attributed to all of these factors( in chronological order) : 1. Early 2019, VF Corp sold of their denim brands (Wrangler and Lee Jeans, now known as Kontoor Brands) as they thought they weren't core to their brand portfolio. Kontoor Brands have since shown resilient growth on the top and bottom line. 2. Dec 2020, they did a $2.1 billion debt-financed acquisition of Supreme, which has since resulted in approximately 800-900 million in impairment cost, and the company has yet to succeed in monetise the Supreme brand and synergise it with their other brands. 3. Over-ordering of inventories during COVID-19, resulting in the need to sell their Vans/Timberland/Dickies inventory at a discount. 4. Throughout 2022 to late 2023, Vans' sales deteriorated 15% year-over-year in 2022 and a further 22% year-over-year in 2023, resulting in an accumulated decline of 35% from peak Vans sales. 5. March 17 2022, FED begins rate hikes to curb inflation. Borrowing costs increased from 0.25% in March 2022 to 5.25% in July 2023. This affected the cost of financing for VFC given their growing debt pile and market participants reflected this by discounting the stock price. 6. In Dec 2022, Steve Rendle, the CEO at the time made a sudden exit from the company during a time of deteriorating sales. Company lost its direction and an interim CEO had to be put in place. 7. After 7 months, in July 2023, a new CEO, Bracken Darrell (former Logitech CEO), was put in place tasked to revitalise the brands, but he subsequently cut revenue and earnings guidance, cut the dividend yield from 4-6% ish to 0.9%, and declared multiple asset write-down. This further crashed the stock price, while the company announced the ""Reinvent"" program, a 4 year plan to bolster growth. 8. As of October 2023, VFC had become a debt-ridden company (7 billion in debt) with upcoming debt maturities to refinance, making it highly susceptible to interest rate fluctuations. The US 10-Year Yield at that time hit a 52-week high of 5% in October 2023, and the stock slid to $13 (-87% from ATH). 9. In April 2024, VFC was dropped from all S&amp;P 500-related indices and the FTSE All-World Index due to its market cap falling into the small-cap category, further contributing to the slide in the share price. 10. On April 11, 2024, the Consumer Price Index (a measure of inflation) was higher than expected, pushing back the need for the FED to cut interest rates, and VFC's stock slid to a 15-year low of $12 per share, last seen during the 2018 Financial Crisis. ## The Turnaround Opportunity Despite the deteriorating sales, I believe the bottom is near, and the company has all the necessary components for a turnaround.

"What is the strangest way you found out a friend was wealthy? Here is my story which may sound like a movie. So, this happened last year in mid-2024. We were all 21-22 year olds Engineering Students doing our summer internship at a renowned tech company in Noida. There was a 21 year old girl with us in the same company, who was pursuing [B.Tech](http://B.Tech) in Computer Science from one of the top colleges in Delhi (One of it from IIITD, DTU and NSUT). She was brilliant-with exceptional Coding skills and Tech knowledge, and was very hardworking. We were 5‚Äì6 students there from different colleges but we all quickly bonded well and became friends. That girl was pretty friendly, had a great sense of humour, smart and was very humble with everybody, and was gorgeous. She looked to hail from a well to do but grounded family. If I go in little detail: 1. She used to dress very well but not flashy and had 3-4 pairs of shoes that she repeated alternatively. All were from brands like Puma and Adidas. 2. She used an iPhone 13 Pro Max-an almost 3 year old model then as it was launched in 2021, and had Airpods as well as a Macbook. 3. She had amazing communication skills and spoke fluent English with a mix of modern slang and impressed us all with her knowledge‚Äînot just in tech, but also in geo-politics, economics, and even Sanskrit. She often quoted the Bhagavad Gita and would explain deep philosophical meanings from it, and all of were very impressed as well as initially surprised. As I'm into spirituality too, we both used to have a good time discussing many aspects of this and I learnt a lot from her. 4. She was very respectful towards everyone and used to speak to the Senior Engineers or the peon/security guard with the same politeness. 5. She used to reside in Noida itself and come to the Office via Metro and E-rickshaw. First, she to used to board from a Metro station nearest to her home in Noida, come to the nearest metro station of Office and then take an E-rickshaw to reach the Office which was about 2-3 kilometres away from the Metro station. In all, she seemed to come from an upper middle class family as per Delhi NCR standards-comfortable, but not ultra-rich. As many youngsters today own an iPhone (For example-I don't come from a rich family (maybe upper middle class) and myself owned an iPhone) and Airpods and branded Shoes, it was kind off ordinary and not something out of the World. Days and weeks passed. After the working hours, we all (5‚Äì6 people) used to eat the street food like Golgappe (that she loved the most) and Momo together after the office hours and were having a good time. She didn‚Äôt seem to be different from us at all in terms of financial background. Until one day. It was the time of mid-August, and there was a sudden and heavy rain at the evening right after the working hours. We were all standing near the gate inside the Office premises chit-chatting and looking at the rain and waiting for it to stop, but it didn‚Äôt give any such signs. 15-20 minutes passed but still, it was raining heavily. 2 people booked cabs and left. We were 4 people left now, when I asked her plans about leaving. She said she would wait for another 10 minutes and if she still couldn‚Äôt find any E-rickshaw, then she will ‚Äúsee‚Äù. As it was raining heavily, there were no E-rickshaws nearby too. (She used to take an E-rickshaw to the Metro station daily.) Neither the rain stopped nor she could find any E-rickshaw and 10 minutes passed. As I was observing her, she sent a text to somebody and right after a minute, got a call. She spoke something for 20 seconds or so and went near the gate and started walking back and forth there as she was waiting for someone. We all went there too and started chit-chatting among ourselves when, after around 10 minutes- a really long, white Car with the windows tinted pulled up right in front of her.

Local Time: 1450 Hours.** I always knew Thalmin was a wolf, or at least, eerily reminiscent of one. Though there was little in the way of his actions (aside from the occasional tail-wag) that really, truly, spoke to his lupine heritage. Not in the way he acted, walked, or carried himself. Not even in the way he spoke. His vocalizations had always been filtered through the translation suite without any issues, though that generally meant that a lot of his *voice* was more than likely lost in the process. However the software *did* attempt to account for this, going so far as to punctuate each and every translated word with subdued interpretations of his wolf-like vocalizations, adding a distinct personal flair to the reconstituted speech. From growls to barks and even the occasional yap, all were integrated into the translated output seamlessly and without any issue. At least, that *had* been the case, until now. ‚ÄúTatcha ti ka. Ultir nes len telrian, Emma?‚Äù The Lupinor mercenary prince all but *barked* out, and unlike before, I could actually *feel* the hefty bass and underlying rumbling that carried through the entirety of his speech. This was the first time I was hearing him completely unfiltered. However, this also meant that *this* first time I was hearing him, without actually *understanding* him. All of this could only mean one thing. *The translation suite was borked.* The mercenary prince continued to stare at me, blinking a few times, cocking his head to the side in confusion and awaiting a response that never came. It was at this point that my training kicked in *hard*, as I reached for my wrist-mounted data-pad, ready to plough through the diagnostics algorithm that had been seared into my head from the countless hours of field maintenance drilling. My fingers flew across the touchscreen, muscle memory kicking in as the proprietary UI was optimized for this very sort of thing: a quick and dirty debugging session that was designed to be as intuitive and as idiot-proof as possible. ‚ÄúLatchow kusi! Ha tal, ke ney sa?‚Äù The wolf continued, now playfully elbowing my armored shoulderguards, beaming out a wide smile as if trying to bridge the veritable chasm that had suddenly formed out of this inexplicable language barrier. Whatever Thalmin was trying to convey was lost on me, even though the context and the casualness of the friendly jab should‚Äôve already clued me in to what was going on. ‚ÄúUltir nes len telrian, Emma?‚Äù The wolf repeated, chuckling to himself a bit as he moved to stand beside me, proceeding to reach his arm over to drape it across my shoulders. ‚ÄúUltir, Emma?‚Äù He reiterated, before snapping his head towards Thacea, beaming out an expectant grin as if egging her on to join in on what I was quickly surmising was a joke I wasn‚Äôt privy to. Thacea‚Äôs reactions confirmed my suspicions, as she looked on at Thalmin with a face of incredulity, completely unamused at the wolf‚Äôs antics. ‚ÄúNow isn‚Äôt the time for fun and games, Thalmin.‚Äù She sighed with a tone of resigned disappointment, before turning to face me. ‚ÄúThamlin seems to be testing the limits of what he believes to be your‚Ä¶ translation artifice, Emma.

There‚Äôs nothing about the game on any public websites, other than this cautionary post. It doesn‚Äôt matter whether you‚Äôre a good or a bad person. It indiscriminately chooses targets. The point is that you can‚Äôt avoid the game. Nobody can. You might hear a reverberating ding from your phone ‚Äî a tolling bell of death from the depths of Hell. And then an incongruous window might pop up. &gt;‚ÄúCan you hide?‚Äù &gt;‚ÄòYes‚Äô ‚Äî ‚ÄòNo‚Äô When the window first appeared on my phone screen, I was stunned.

There was nothing about the ‚ÄòCan you hide?‚Äô pop-up online. I didn‚Äôt even realise it was a game until a Reddit user, who I won‚Äôt name, pointed me in the direction of a Discord server for discussing unearthly matters. There was an entire category dedicated to the bizarre new game that had been appearing on people‚Äôs phones. Clicking ‚ÄòYes‚Äô, apparently, commences a hide-and-seek game of unknown origin. I scrolled through the many Discord messages. I‚Äôve removed the usernames. *User 1: Can anyone help me? Nobody seems to know anything about this game. My friend played it non-stop for a week, and then he went missing. That was two weeks ago. There are daily search parties, but I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre going to find him. He said it wasn‚Äôt really a game. He said he saw a face outside his window.* *User 2: You have to select ‚ÄòNo‚Äô.* *User 3: I destroyed my phone after reading these messages. Haven‚Äôt seen or heard anything unusual.* *User 4: I selected ‚ÄòNo‚Äô, but I keep hearing creaks. And I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs in my head.* *User 6: Just leave the pop-up window open, guys. You don‚Äôt have to select anything.* *User 5: What? For the rest of my life? What if something accidentally knocks it?* *User 3: Destroy your phone. Like I said, it worked for me.* *User 6: Until it pops up on your next phone.* *User 5: What if I just turn off my phone? That seems a little less dramatic than destroying it.* *User 3: Your funeral.* The more I read, the more anxious I felt.

I heard the bombs drop about an hour after my last post. The bunker shook so hard I thought it was going to collapse on me, but after the last explosion, the walls and the ceiling remained solid. Without Craig and his prepper tendencies I wouldn‚Äôt be alive right now. I didn‚Äôt know him too well, but I can‚Äôt let his death be in vein. When I first got in here, the creatures continued pounding on the door relentlessly, but to my relief none of them had managed to make their way into the bunker before I did. After the final bomb dropped, the outside world went silent. From inside the bunker, it seemed like the creatures hadn‚Äôt even made a dent in the thick metal door that separated me from them. After hours of listening for any activity outside the door, I collapsed onto the bed. Craig had installed a single cot which wasn‚Äôt particularly comfortable, but with the sense of a seemingly safe environment to lay down in and the fact that it was a hell of a lot more comfortable than the wooden floor in the attic, I managed to fall asleep. I had vivid nightmares of the creatures that night and woke up in a cold sweat. I opened my eyes and was looking directly up at the ceiling. I tried to lift my head, but something stopped me. My body was stiff and rejected every signal I gave it to move, it felt heavy, like gravity had increased 10 fold and I was stuck. That‚Äôs when I noticed in the corner of my eye, the dark figure that stood in the opposite corner of the room. Its shadow cast by the small battery operated light on the wall next to me, I struggled to make out who or what it was that had found its way into this safe place I thought I had secured. The figure started moving towards me and my heart skipped a beat. The figure‚Äôs face became illuminated by the light, and its huge sunken eyes stared back into mine. I wanted to scream. I wanted to jump out of the bed I was helplessly lying in and do something about the situation I had found myself in, but the closer the creature got to me, the less control I felt I had over my own body. Its tall form reached higher than most professional basketball players, with its head nearly touching the bunker‚Äôs relatively low ceiling. At this range I could make out more details about the creature. Tightly bound to its thin body, the creatures dark skin appeared charred, its huge eyes remained the only recognisable characteristic on its face, and its long, sharp, finger like claws taunted me. The creature arched its head down towards me and its face grew closer to mine. It felt as though the creature was sucking the soul from my body. The sheer terror I felt and the malicious force this creature exuded forced me to squeeze my eyes closed and wait for the inevitable to occur. But nothing happened. Moments passed and I waited... still nothing. I opened my eyes again and the creature was gone, I tried to get off the bed and my body finally responded, the weight that held me down had suddenly lifted. Completely shaken, I examined the place the creature had been before I closed my eyes and found no trace. The creature had vanished‚Ä¶ or maybe it was never there in the first place. But it felt so real. I‚Äôd never experienced sleep paralysis before, but those creatures had an unimaginable effect on my psyche it seemed.

There's pretty much nothing to actually do in Primm. 11. becoming a Great Khan 12. potential Vaults (like Vault 24) 13. reclaiming control of Helios One on behalf of the Brotherhood of Steel 14. weapons, characters (like Mr. House's Marilyn Securitron)... 15. radioactive tumbleweeds 16.

More... &amp;#x200B; * in addition of the cut content, **additional new content** (like Resident Evil remakes (1 &amp; 2) and Final Fantasy 7 Remake did) : 1. more random encounters 2. a new Vault with a new experiment 3. new quests (expand the Brotherhood of Steel as a main faction ? Edit: I worded this badly, I don't mean making the BoS more powerful but just additional quests (if done well) to expand their storyline or something to highlight even more the terrible/dying state of the Mojave Chapter.

Madison Cawthorn (R-NC) was caught attempting to bring a loaded 9mm handgun through airport security in North Carolina‚Äîfor the second time. Law enforcement [said](https://twitter.com/CMPD/status/1519027485568028673?s=20&amp;t=VH9CZkrkJ7gtqYHl1DOTsg) TSA agents discovered the gun in Cawthorn‚Äôs bag on Tuesday. The lawmaker admitted it was his firearm and was issued a citation for ‚ÄúPossession of a Dangerous Weapon on City Property, which is a City of Charlotte Ordinance.‚Äù &gt;Mr. Cawthorn was released, and the CMPD took possession of the firearm, which is normal procedure‚Ä¶ It is standard procedure for the CMPD Airport Division to cite in lieu of arrest for the misdemeanor charge of Possession of a Dangerous Weapon on City Property unless there are other associated felony charges or extenuating circumstances.

That is a normal outcome, said airport spokeswoman Tina Kinsey‚Ä¶ &gt;The Republican-majority state legislature stripped a joint Asheville-Buncombe County board of oversight of the airport in 2012. The General Assembly gave control to a new Greater Asheville Regional Airport Authority, which makes it owns rules. Those say ""it shall be unlawful for any person, except those persons to the extent authorized by federal law and/or state law, to carry or transport any firearm or weapon on the airport property except when such firearm or weapon is properly encased for shipment."" &gt;Breaking that law is considered a criminal misdemeanor, according to airport ordinances. It was not clear why the eight people, including Cawthorn had not been charged. --- #Knives Cawthorn also had a streak of allegedly carrying knives on to school properties last year, even after warnings from local law enforcement. Bringing knives onto school grounds is a class 1 misdemeanor in North Carolina.

"CMV: The pay-gap in Women's National Football is fair (Unless specifically noted, this post concerns the state of Women's football in the US and Europe) Obligatory statement of my general views on the broader social issue at play: * Women have historically faced, and continue to face, unfair labor practices. * There exists a general pay gap for equal work rendered in most industries, though it is not nearly as large of a gap (nor simple to calculate) as the often-quoted ""$0.72 per $1.00 earned by a man"" * I enjoy Women's football and believe it has proven value in the media/entertainment/cultural landscape. * I am not persuaded by the argument ""men should be paid more for X sport because the worst men's team would still demolish the best women's team."" &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; **Why I hold this view:** &amp;#x200B; * Men's and Women's tournaments in the same sport are NOT ""Equal Work."" The LA Times compared sports teams to assembly line workers who, unarguably, deserve the same pay whether they put together a low-selling commuter car or a blockbuster high-end luxury sedan. But athletes aren't skilled workers, they are performers, and their work is to entertain a *specific audience*. The audience IS the work in this equation! Both Beyonce and Justin Bieber perform live music, but they are not doing equal work even though significant portions of their audience may overlap. &amp;#x200B; * In the sports industry, revenue is generated not by the volume of goals scored, but by the volume of people willing to pay to watch it happen and buy products branded to their teams and heroes. &amp;#x200B; * The men's World Cup in Russia generated over [$6 billion](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/sports/fifa-revenue.html) in revenue, with the participating teams sharing [$400 million](https://www.goal.com/en-us/news/world-cup-2018-prize-money-how-much-do-the-winners-get-countries-/h9rstxkx3z6k1c8eonct5g1xa), less than 7% of revenue. Meanwhile, the Women's World Cup is expected to earn [$131 million](https://resources.fifa.com/image/upload/fifa-financial-report-2017.pdf?cloudid=pinrmrodexmnqoettgqw) for the full four-year cycle 2019-22 and dole out $30 million to the participating teams... just shy of 23% of revenue. Factoring in the WWC's total team roster at 24 v.s. the MWC's roster of 32, the per-team-per-player revenue share is substantially higher for the Women's teams. &amp;#x200B; * Claims that the Women's team in the US brings in more money than the Men's team is cherry-picked data. This is true for the past few years, but over the long term, the more established men‚Äôs game brings in consistently higher game revenue year over year. &amp;#x200B; * Revenue sharing does not scale linearly; a fixed percent of revenue for both Men's and Women's tournaments is thus an unfair risk to the governing corporate body (it pains me to say this -- I hate FIFA just as much as everybody). In other words, committing 10% of $100 million in expected revenue is a much greater financial liability than committing 10% of $1 Billion. &amp;#x200B; * Molly Levinson, the spokesperson for the women‚Äôs national team said, regarding their lawsuit, ‚ÄúThese athletes generate more revenue and garner higher TV ratings but get paid less simply because they are women.‚Äù The data disagree. While the women‚Äôs team [broke viewing records](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/07/sports/soccer/womens-world-cup-final-was-most-watched-soccer-game-in-united-states-history.html?module=inline) in the US during the WWC, ratings for men‚Äôs games have been more than double those for women‚Äôs games, on average, since 2012, according to Nielsen calculations. Excluding World Cup games, the men‚Äôs team‚Äôs ratings are almost four times as high. &amp;#x200B; * The US Soccer Federation is genuinely good at rewarding top talent regardless of gender.

That‚Äôs *Polstj√§rnan* (literal translation, ‚ÄúPole Star‚Äù) if you‚Äôre Swedish. * Polestar was started in 1996 by Volvo‚Äôs partner, Flash/Polestar Racing. * Volvo acquired Polestar in 2015. Volvo had itself been acquired in 2010 by Geely, a China-based auto brand that sells vehicles under the brands Geely Auto, Lotus, Lynk &amp; Co, Proton, and Volvo. Geely sold over 2.4 million cars in 2020. * Volvo and Geely describe the Polestar brand as being ‚Äúindependent since 2017.‚Äù * Polestar is co-owned by Volvo and Geely, and headquartered in Gothenburg, Sweden. * Polestar is now being taken public at a $20B valuation by the Gores-Guggenheim, ticker GGPI. **Comps** **GGPI is trading at a significant discount to TSLA and LCID, based on EV/sales multiples.** * Applying Tesla‚Äôs 2023E multiple to Polestar implies a share price of $42.51 As GGPI is currently trading at $13.72, this yields an increase of 210%. * Applying Lucid‚Äôs 2023E multiple to Polestar implies a share price of $47.58. As GGPI is currently trading at $13.72, this yields an increase of 247%. &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/vrmfi8ga7d181.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c0a7af961e3f7ee4e20df9747b005fbff44af7d **Peer Multiples -- EV Pure Plays** * GGPI is essentially valued at the same forward multiples as XPEV and NIO. * Bear in mind, XPEV and NIO are higher-risk companies that deserve valuation discounts because: 1. The CCP can theoretically shut them down at any moment without warning (see: $DIDI). 2. The stocks are actually ADRs and based in the Cayman Islands, so you don't even own the actual companies. * By comparison, GGPI is headquartered in Sweden and already US-listed on the Nasdaq. * Polestar is already an established OEM, leveraging the strategic relationship with Volvo in manufacturing, design and marketing. Hence, the investment opportunity is lower risk since Polestar is not a start-up. * As with most present-day multinationals, there is some China-related production risk. However, Polestar is addressing the issue by opening US factories going forward. https://preview.redd.it/n5mgt00e7d181.png?width=588&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7487924a42825ba052899aa03fc4fae3d1abe9ec **Gores' Deals** Gores‚Äô track record speaks for itself‚Ä¶ https://preview.redd.it/t1uq0jcg7d181.jpg?width=1972&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6571264d9347fd8f8c237881e1d511b8cca7fae **The EV Graveyard** The EV battlefield is littered with bodies.

"Psych Insights into Harry‚Äôs Mind from Spare: What He Accidentally Reveals Spare is how Harry sees himself, and how he wants the world to see him - not necessarily the objective facts. But he doesn‚Äôt realize he reveals more than he realizes. Feel free to save this post as a reference. Much has been written about the content, but less on what it reveals about Harry‚Äôs perceptions about himself. (Forgot this in my drafts folder, but Engdame and Harry‚Äôs lawsuits certainly make Spare relevant for another varying account.) Here‚Äôs some **fascinating recent background from the ghostwriter**: * he spent a lot of time living at Montecito: [https://archive.ph/2023.05.08-190000/https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/meghan-markles-kind-gesture-prince-29927969](https://archive.ph/2023.05.08-190000/https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/meghan-markles-kind-gesture-prince-29927969) * even he was fighting with Harry for plausibility (reading between the lines, Harry wanted to sound like a GI Joe / Call of Duty war hero, especially the military sections). This fits with cutting 400 pages. * he‚Äôs been quoted saying Harry learns ‚Äúat a glacial pace‚Äù. This implies frustration reasoning with him over inclusions, revisions, and edits. Harry‚Äôs brand identity he‚Äôs promoting (and believes) is: grieving son, brave and accomplished soldier, cheeky lad, lonely family member, victim of the Royal family, loather of the press, heroic husband. Current brand emphasis on thriving and faintly messianic, David vs Goliath press, humanitarian carrying on his mother‚Äôs legacy. Harry is likely not a narcissist (although Meg shows traits, and has the childhood risk factors). I can see why some symptoms may flag initially, but there are likely significant other mental health issues going on with Harry. For a general armchair speculations of H‚Äôs mental state, can add in the comments, if requested. What stood out to me from Spare: 1. **He NEVER takes accountability for his actions.** Glosses over breakups with Chelsea as a soldier off to war narrative, can‚Äôt see it working long term but he never seems to communicate that with her. His ‚Äòsecond parents‚Äô in Botswana have to physically sit him down with her to get him to admit to there is no future. Implies she feels the same, yet why would she continually go back with him if she didn‚Äôt think there was some future?

"Manager, fire this worker. Time to have some funüòà I‚Äôm new to this sub reddit, but I‚Äôve seen enough RSlash videos on YouTube to know how these stories go. A brief background, I‚Äôm middle eastern who live in the United Arab Emirates in the capital of Abu Dhabi. I‚Äôm a local but I don‚Äôt look it as my mother is from Egypt, and I would get mistaken for other nationalities often. On to the story: My niece got a new pet about a month ago from one of her friends, a 5 month old german shepherd, and she‚Äôs the cutest thing ever imo. Unfortunately, the friend didn‚Äôt bring enough food for the puppy, so I went the next day to a hypermarket nearby to buy some for her. I was told she liked a particular brand, so I decided to go inside without a cart or basket to see if they had it, then go back out for a cart. On my way to the pet food isle I heard shouting and yelling from close by and out of curiosity I went to check it out. I saw one of the workers and a wild Karen. While she didn‚Äôt LOOK like a Karen, she sure as hell ACTED like one, screaming at the poor guy about how ‚Äúincompetent and rude he is‚Äù, and ‚Äúignoring her when she was trying to get his attention‚Äù, and of course, she was yelling for a manager. That‚Äôs when she turned around and locked eyes with ME, and made a beeline to where I was. Now keep in mind the workers uniform is a yellow or light blue shirt with the hypermarket name on it in big letters, and the managers wear full suits, I was wearing black jeans and a dark blue shirt. Also, majority of the staff were either from India or the Philippines. Now for the cast OL: obnoxious lady, PW: poor worker, M: manager, Me: yours truly. OL: You, manager, this employee of yours was very rude to me, he ignored me when I was trying to get his attention for 10 minutes and is refusing to help me and yelled at me, I want him FIRED. The first thought that came to mind was to tell her that I didn‚Äôt work there, but after seeing the condition PW was in, I decided to have some fun. Now my English has a good American accent, but I also have a fairly decent Indian accent, so without hesitation I switched my accent to Indian mode. Me: I‚Äôm so sorry madam, we‚Äôve had many complaints about this problem worker, don‚Äôt worry, I will discipline him. And as a form of apology, please go about your shopping and at the cashier, just give them my name, Roger Patel, and tell them I approved a 40% discount on the total sum for you. OL: At least management knows how to treat PAYING customers. I went to PW, grabbed his arm and started walking away, ‚Äúberating‚Äù him along the way until we made a turn and we were out of sight of OL, that‚Äôs when the PW said: Am I in trouble? It seems PW was new and also mistook me for a manager, and he thought he was going to be fired (poor guy). Me(laughing): I‚Äôm not a manager and you‚Äôre not in any trouble, I just wanted to get you away from her. And I walked away waving goodbye at him. I grabbed a cart, and went on to buy my puppy her chow and some other things for her (some toys, a new collar, a leash and a comfy bed), and some other items for myself. After I grabbed what I needed I made my way to the cashier, that‚Äôs when I heard a familiar screaming and yelling, and sure enough there was OL, arguing with one of the cashiers and an actual manager, trying to convince them that she was allowed the huge discount on all her items (a full carts worth), while I was laughing on the inside. Then she spotted me, pointed at me and yelled, OL: That‚Äôs him, that‚Äôs Roger Patel, the manager who approved my discount. The manager and cashier both looked at me with confusion in their eyes, and the manager said, M: Ma‚Äôam, this gentleman doesn‚Äôt work here. OL: Yes he does, why else would he give me the discount? He was even disciplining one of your workers. M and OL made their way to me, and I acted like I didn‚Äôt know what was going on. M, pointing at OL: Excuse me sir, do you know this lady?

"The Body in the Barn: In 2017 skeletal remains were located in a disused barn in rural Hampshire, UK. They lay unnoticed and untouched for 5 years. Who was this travelling Frenchman? In 2017, the skeletal remains of a [male](https://imgur.com/a/Sz8dMv8) were located in a disused barn near Micheldever, Hampshire, UK. In 2019 witnesses came forward stating the male was a French traveller, whom they met in 2012. It is believed he died shortly after this meeting. Despite various tests, including fingerprint and DNA testing, he is yet to be identified. **The body in the barn** On 1st December 2017, units from Hampshire Constabulary were searching the Micheldever area as part of an unrelated investigation when officers came across an old and disused barn. Officers entered and searched the barn when they located the skeletal remains of an unknown male. The barn itself was a disused cattle shed, which formed part of the abandoned Borough Down Farm. The site was heavily overgrown and had not been used for over 50 years. Due to the remote location of the barn, it is unlikely any persons would be passing by other than the occasional dog walker. [Here](https://imgur.com/a/vW8EilO) you can find a photo of the barn in its proximity to Micheldever, a small village 6 miles north of Winchester. As you can see it‚Äôs a fairly rural location, adjacent to the train line which runs south to Winchester and north to Basingstoke. [Here](https://imgur.com/a/g2zEqdf) is a bird‚Äôs eye view of the area itself. The area is largely overgrown with trees and bushes; several buildings can be seen in this overgrown area and it is not clear which building is the barn in question. There is no photo available of the front of the barn itself. Clothing found with the remains were a pair of Wellington Boots (size 10), a blue zip-up fleece jacket, a blue jumper, and jogging trousers. Although not stated, the reconstruction shows the male also wearing a grey beanie hat. The blue jumper found on the remains contained a label with the words ‚Äòcasual sportif‚Äô and the image of a fleur-de-lis. I‚Äôve been unable to find whether ‚ÄòCasual Sportif‚Äô is the brand or simply a line of clothing (meaning ‚Äòsporty-casual‚Äô). The French words and image of the fleur-de-lis however implies the clothing is of French origin. Several further items were found alongside the skeletal remains, including: ¬∑ A sleeping bag ¬∑ A black Karrimor rucksack ¬∑ An umbrella ¬∑ An A-Z map of Great Britain. Written on the front of the book is ‚ÄúWaterloo ‚Äì Winchester. ¬£27.20/2‚Äù. ¬∑ The novel ‚ÄòThe Close‚Äô by Marina Cole, released in 2006 ¬∑ Reading glasses ¬∑ White t-shirt ¬∑ 4/5 white flannels ¬∑ 2 packets of polos ¬∑ A pack of Germolene (anti-septic cream) ¬∑ Garden trowel ¬∑ A pair of yellow gardening/outdoor gloves and a pair of black cotton gloves. ¬∑ Flask ¬∑ Torch ¬∑ A Sony Walkman-style radio ¬∑ Tobacco and rizla papers ¬∑ Various food wrappers ¬∑ A pack of Zantac (to relieve heartburn and indigestion. In 2020 the FDA removed Zantac globally due to its link to cancer seen in animals). No form of identification was found with the remains Whilst not all items have had photos released to the public, all available photos of these items can be found [here](https://imgur.com/a/4gLin4P). **Investigation and identity** A post mortem examination was conducted on the remains which showed no signs of assault or restraint. Although no cause of death could be identified, due to the lack of apparent suspicious circumstances, the corner ruled that it was likely the male died from natural causes. The coroner stated he would have died *at least* a year prior to discovery. The male was determined to be middle aged, although possibly older, 5‚Äô6-5‚Äô7 in height, medium build, with short brown hair and a narrow face. He was also believed to possibly have an overbite. It was also stated the male had good dental care in his younger life, however poorer dental health in his later life ‚Äì there is no further information regarding this statement.

"From a Broken Omega to the Northern Queen Looking for link Chapter 1 After seven years in a dungeon for a crime I didn't commit, my fated mate, the Alpha who let them drag me away, finally opened my cell door. He announced I would take my place as his Luna, not out of love, but because the law demanded it. But the moment a frantic mind-link came through that his precious Seraphina--my adopted sister, the one who framed me--was having trouble breathing, he abandoned me without a second glance. That night, huddled in a dusty shack, I overheard my own parents' secret conversation. They were planning to have me exiled. Permanently. My return had upset Seraphina, and her ""weak heart"" couldn't take the shock. I lay there in the darkness, feeling nothing. Not surprise. Not even pain. Just a profound, empty coldness. They were casting me out. Again. But as they plotted my exile, a secret message arrived for me--an offer of escape. A new life in a sanctuary far to the north, where I could leave the Blackmoon Pack behind forever. They thought they were getting rid of me. Little did they know, I was already gone. Chapter 1 No.1 Elara POV: The heavy iron door groaned open, its protest echoing in the damp stone cell that had been my world for seven years. Light, sharp and unfamiliar, sliced through the gloom, forcing me to squint. My muscles, atrophied from long disuse and poor nutrition, trembled as I pushed myself to my feet. A sharp, searing pain shot up my right leg, a permanent reminder of the silver shackle that had once bound me here. It had left me with a limp, a constant, nagging ache that was now a part of who I was. ""Elara."" The voice was deeper than I remembered, stripped of the warmth it held in my childhood memories. It was a voice that resonated with power, a sound that made the very stones seem to vibrate. It was the voice of my mate. My Alpha. Kaelen stood silhouetted against the blinding light of the doorway. He was taller, broader, his presence filling the cramped space with an oppressive energy. The scent of him--a potent mix of winter pine and the clean, sharp air before a storm-- flooded my senses, a scent that should have brought comfort but now only felt like a cage. ""The elders have agreed to your release,"" he stated, his tone flat, devoid of any emotion. He took a step inside, his dark eyes scanning my frail form with an unnerving detachment. ""As per the laws of the Moon Goddess, you are still my fated mate. You will take your place as my Luna."" I said nothing. My heart, a tired, worn-out muscle, gave a feeble flutter and then settled back into its slow, rhythmic beat. The bond between us, that sacred connection the Goddess bestowed upon mated pairs, was a phantom limb. It was there, a dull throb in the back of my soul, but it was fractured, scarred over from the day he stood by and watched them drag me to this dungeon. He seemed to take my silence as acquiescence. ""Your parents... the pack elders, could not be here. Seraphina is unwell. Her heart condition has flared up again."" Seraphina. The name was like ash in my mouth. My adopted sister. The one whose place I was born to take, but who had stolen everything from me instead. A bitter laugh threatened to escape my lips, but I swallowed it down. I was the true-born daughter of the pack's Beta, a direct descendant of the Alpha bloodline. Yet, at birth, a mistaken prophecy had labeled me an Omega, the lowest of the low. My parents, in their grief and disappointment, had adopted Seraphina, the orphaned daughter of the Gamma, and showered her with the love and status that should have been mine. I was forced to yield everything to her--my toys, my training, my position. And finally, my freedom. I had taken the fall for her, accused of conspiring with rogues, a crime she had committed. And Kaelen, my own mate, had believed the lie. ""Come,"" he said, turning his back to me, assuming I would follow. I did.

You know that type of town with rude attitudes of people who act like they've never worked a day in their life? Well here's my IDWHL story involving said town. When I got to the store, the parking lot was packed, nice cars everywhere along with shopping carts scattered. Im friendly with some of the people that work at the store so I grabbed two carts and took them inside. I should note that I'm wearing black dress pants and a pink long sleeve button up blouse with silver buttons with a grey zip up hoodie, I also don't carry a purse. (The uniform for this grocery store is black shoes black pants and a black short sleeve polo.) I leave one of the carts in the entrance and continue inside. Right away this woman puts her hand on the front of my cart and tries to pull it away. I'll call her CL for crazy lady CL ""Oh thank you so much, there aren't any carts left inside."" Me ""Uh sorry this one is mine."" Trying to pull it back. CL ""Well maybe you should get a different one."" Me ""Yeah there's always that option, but I don't work here."" Still pulling on my cart. CL ""Listen here young lady that is my cart I saw it first when you brought it in to drop it off."" Her children are starting to cry and scream which doesn't make anyone's day better. ""Listen, I need this cart NOW."" Me ""Umm?"" CL ""Don't just stand there looking at me like an idiot, give me my damn cart!!"" Me ""Excuse me, but this is my cart, I brought it in from outside for the specific reason of using it."" CL ""Well go get another one! I have shopping to do!"" At this point she's yanking on my cart. Me ""What the hell are you doing?"" I'm aggravated. CL looks at me with the angriest face possible and starts to almost shout ""This is MY CART."" Me ""Listen Broomhilda, this is my shopping cart! I don't work here go outside and get one!"" CL ""I'm going to report you! You'll lose your job. You've been very rude!"" Me ""Good, report me, after you report me how about you go fuck yourself?"" I pulled the cart away, shoved passed her and did my shopping. The lady comes up to me again this time with a store employee. She's going on and on about how rude I was to her and how I should be fired. The guy looks at me and convinces CL that I do in fact not work there and never have. It's not great but I thought it would do good here. Broomhilda is something my Dad always called bitchy women. I'm not sure what it means but it sounds offensive enough.

"DD: Gamestop Price Analysis -- still a Deep Fucking Value under $550 **TLDR;** Gamestop is undervalued considering its online sales numbers and ecommerce focus - analysts haven‚Äôt caught up yet from Q4 Earning report; add on top of that all the hiring of Amazon execs and VPs and Gamestop Valuation is about to explode upward. On its current trajectory $550-750 a share is a reasonable (my worthless opinion) price point, with or without the squeeze. Not only is buying GME a play on the squeeze, but also a deep fucking value bet. Fair warning, you'll develop a wrinkle of two if you proceed... but don‚Äôt worry my fellow ape brethren I‚Äôve included charts, with colors, to make visualization easy. Let‚Äôs walk through these figures one by one and tell the story of Gamestop‚Äôs transition. \*\*\*\*\*\*\* # Chapter 1: Gamestop‚Äôs Advantage in its Transition to Online. Let‚Äôs start with the ugly before we get to the good stuff: **Operating Loss**. An operating loss occurs when a company's operating expenses exceed gross profits. Gamestop has had a fairly significant operating loss for many years now (peaking in 2018), as it faced the challenges all brick and mortar stores faced: theft of sales to the e-commerce giants -- the convenience of online downloads and pre-ordering on the internet. In the last two years, this loss has come down significantly. And what impresses me most about Gamestop is their cash on hand (currently $635M). Very few stores with operating losses have that level of cash. Most are in debt, and require the sale of shares to float by during rough times. [Gamestop Operating Loss per Year](https://preview.redd.it/4e698fbbneq61.png?width=1579&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a7de50dda8fa00983cdec3285c1025a9ad83ca5) And this is the key misstep the HF‚Äôs made in shorting Gamestop. There has been a stigma out there about brick and mortar stores going under (Toys R Us, and Sears as example)... feeding frenzy, blood in the water you get the point. Sharks (HFs) have been getting more and more bold (reckless) in their targeting. Gamestop was the wrong target, for a very specific reason. It leases its stores. By comparison, consider Walmart needing to reduce stores, or Target. They‚Äôve built massive buildings with parking lots to house their very specific store needs (huge upfront costs, sunk), and they rent (or own) these buildings under much different contracts. They can‚Äôt easily get up and leave one of their stores. Ask yourself, how would Walmart leave a store? Who would buy it? How could the investor renting to them turn it into something else? Maybe a city might want it to build an expo center. On the cheap. WalMarts costs are priced into this (it‚Äôs expensive). They can‚Äôt move as easily. Point being, Gamestop doesn‚Äôt owe anything to shut down a store, it simply stops paying its lease and moves all it‚Äôs stuff out. They rent strip mall locations and mall storefronts. This allows them to liquidate stores and downsize with little to no sunk costs. They can also reposition themselves much more efficiently. This is why we see this fast turn-around in Operating Loss last year (a major component of Operating Loss is storefront costs for Brick and Mortar). News of Gamestop closing stores isn‚Äôt bad news. Remember that. The media will try to sell it as such. Because of the focus, Gamestop is eyeing Digital Sales, for its future. # Chapter 2: Digital Sales Growth It is clear to everyone, at this point, that Gamestop is looking to move a large portion of its business into the online space. In 2020 Gamestop did $580Million in sales online, and in Q4 alone their online sales represented over 34% of all Gamestop sales; Gamestop did more in online sales in the 4th quarter of 2020 than it did in all of 2019. &amp;#x200B; [Gamestop: Online Sales Growth by Year](https://preview.redd.it/rsvos30pneq61.png?width=1530&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2edf09bb5bd5d1de86557b06c28b938c4f3dcbd7) So what caused this?

"Compelling case on why all 30 NBA franchises should move cities Sure, some team names make perfect sense for their location (Pistons, Hornets, Nuggets, Celtics), while some team names require a historian to explain (Lakers, Jazz, Grizzlies). And then some teams are just lame weather reports (Heat, Suns, Thunder), while others are entertainment industry advertisements (Magic, Raptors, 76ers). And then there are all dum animal names that are completely interchangeable. The point is each franchise has to move and not just swap names but take their entire organization with them, players and all. Judging criteria is simple: * Clearly a better fitting name for the city. * Should be inspirational for what the city wants to be perceived as. * Or, let‚Äôs be honest, most of these will not make any sense at all. I‚Äôm just chasing a perfect loop here. Let‚Äôs start this one off with 2020 Champs: Lakers! - **LAKERS**. Sure, it would make sense to send this team back to Minnesota where they have more lakes than black people, but there is another place where ‚Äúlake‚Äù is literally in their official city motto. ‚ÄúMistake by the Lake‚Äù **CLEVELAND LAKERS**(sorry Bron) - **CAVALIERS**. This team name is a weird reference to a bunch of US presidents being born in Ohio. But when we think of Ohio, do we think of failed rust belt cities, unemployment and poverty, urban decay, opioid crisis, or do we think of the POTUS? Come on! **WASHINGTON CAVALIERS** - **WIZARDS**. The whole nerd lore of wizards and spells and trolls and magic is of European origin dating back to illiterate medieval surfs being afraid of wooded areas. Make up your own fables US! New Orleans voodoo? Now that‚Äôs some proper spicy home brewed shit! **NEW ORLEANS WIZARDS** - **PELICANS**. Sure, that‚Äôs Louisiana‚Äôs state bird, but these flying rodents are all over the gulf region. And some of the Louisiana ones are brown but lots of them are white as toilet paper. That‚Äôs not very NBA. You have to go east to find the true urban pelicans-of-color: **MIAMI PELICANS** - **HEAT** Vikings intentionally swapped names of Greenland and Iceland in a brilliant real estate marketing ploy. It didn‚Äôt work out of course, but maybe it worked on just enough ‚Äòright‚Äô people. Toronto doesn‚Äôt need to fool all players into thinking Toronto is not literally located on the north pole. Just enough of them to fill a roster that is not an all-scrubs-team. Also Toronto actually does have really beautiful summers. All 6 weeks of them! **TORONTO HEAT** - **RAPTORS**. Dinosaurs have always been a major point of contention for all western religions. Their existence really spoil the plot of ‚ÄúTHE GOD‚Äù S1E 1. When Mormons ended up settling in what is now modern day Utah, they ended up in a region with one of the richest fossil deposits in the world. Look to the ground and dinosaur bones everywhere! So, what is LDS Church‚Äôs take on dinos? ‚ÄúUhh it is not important that they existed or not uhh like, that‚Äôs not the main plotline anyways, can we talk about something else?‚Äù lol **UTAH RAPTORS** - **JAZZ** Jazz originates in New Orleans, no doubt about that one. But! Jazz is such a quintessential American style of music that spread like wildfire across the nation. LA-Chicago-NYC. Truly the original hip hop where you didn‚Äôt need no words to cuss at the world. But it was Chicago Daily Tribune who first ever coined the word Jazz back in 1915. Also, best Jazz I have personally seen was in Chicago. Makes all other Jazz sound like Drake. **CHICAGO JAZZ** - **BULLS** If I was literally a bull, I would probably move to Wall Street NY where they already have a statue of me. Or just maybe, move to a place that has a lot of cows. Apparently Texas has 11 million cows. That is more cows than human population of 43 individual US states.

"The amount of contractors who are willing to lie to clueless home owners and take advantage of them is stunning- make sure you learn about your own home. I‚Äôve owned 4 different homes in a short period of time. Lived in all 4 corners of the country and done several renovations/repairs, even a build from the ground up. Ive made mistakes and learned from them. Over time Ive made my own list of honest and hard working contractors while also becoming aware of the amount of lying, two-faced contractors out there. So this story starts in Houston, Texas. A few days ago, in my 1994 home, my AC seemed to not be working so great. Ive changed two AC systems in my last house (3 and 5 ton) and had a general idea of how things work, what components fail, etc. Long story short, my 2006 system is leaking and it was getting pretty hot on a Sunday so I called an HVAC company to come and fill some refrigerant so I could get through the weekend. My intention was to have my regular hvac guy come out on Monday and evaluate repairs. I already spent 3 hours in my attic evaluating all the components before calling a big box company. Long story short, their ‚Äútechnician‚Äù came out and had no clue how any of the ducts ran (I did), couldnt figure out the problem (very obvious from a pressure test), and basically started telling me I need an entire new system without really evaluating whats going on. The answer by the way, is a leaking coil- but I was already in the mood to change the system. The guy tried to sell me a garbage brand Lennox 4 ton system for $24,000 while claiming its on a special from $36,000 and I need to act on it while supplies last. I told him I couldnt afford that and I really just want him to add some 410a to my system which is what I said in my service call. He then started to offer financing options. The thing is- I paid around $7000 just 2 years ago for a 3 ton American standard and $12,000 for a 5 ton Trane- so I already knew a ball park estimate. He then started getting into how bad of a brand Trane and American standard are and tried to sell me again on their Lennox garbage. I told him Ill be more than glad to pay for some refrigerant but I am not getting a system from them. He eventually filled it, I paid him his dues, and today my regular hvac guy came out. Im getting an American Standard 5 ton, 14.3 seer for around $12,000 all in. Obviously the big box company is around because home owners who dont know much are fear- sold into overpriced garbage. Ive also heard of contractors in the north charging obscene prices for their systems ($20-$30 k for replacements).

"Korean TFD Community is in Dire Straits Right Now. Please Help Us. Hey TFD Reddit Fam, The Korean TFD community is facing significant challenges right now. We could seriously use a lifeline here. I lurk on this subreddit a lot, but I'm mostly active in the Korean community. I'm reaching out here to take responsibility on behalf of the Korean community for the actions we took at TGS (Tokyo Game Show) 2024 and to explain why we behaved the way we did.

The 'MapleStory probability manipulation' scandal. That mess tanked Nexon's reputation and their hater count went through the roof. * Thanks to stuff like this, there's a popular meme going around Korean internet that basically calls anyone playing Nexon games a sucker. * Korean gamers also tagged Nexon with the nickname 'Don-xon' because they've got this image of chasing profits way harder than fun when making games. It's a play on words meaning either ""Nexcess"" (Nexon + Excess) or ""Nexploit"" (Nexon + Exploit). [\[ Text: \\""Looks Awfully Familiar\\""...

"North Face ""Base Camp"" Duffel vs Patagonia ""Black Hole Duffel""? For someone with an illness that could kill me in my 20s, who would like the perfect bag for their next (and maybe final) trip? üëåüèª Hey all, hope you're all well. As the title implies, I am quite unwell and may not have much longer on this earth. Hence asking this question, despite it being asked over and over, because I have **quite unique requirements**. **TLDR: Which duffel suits me best, for 1-2 week trips, out of the 40L Patagonia, 55L Patagonia, or 71L North Face (or smaller North Face), given that this may be my final trip, and given that money is tight due to medical treatments etc?** At the moment, I own several Evergoods backpacks and slings. I also own (or semi-own, shared with my partner) an old-style, bright red, plasticky-looking Patagonia Black Hole duffel in 55L (I hate the colour and look of it, only got it as it was like $100 USD off). Other than that, I just have a medium-size American Tourister suitcase. Anyway, long story short, I'd like to get a new duffel. Part of it is that I've always hated the shiny look of the Patagonia duffels - no longer an issue with this 2024 update. But it has annoyed me for years, our bright red Patagonia üò° It would be used primarily for trips 1-2 weeks long, naturally sometimes just a weekend trip, pretty much always domestically. I'm someone who struggles to pack smartly and minimally - especially in winter. So that's something to consider, but I'm getting back into it, meaning the whole ""minimalist"" carrying thing. I would largely have the ability to wash my clothes on the go. It would need to fit: probably enough clothes for five days, including business shoes + a toiletries/dopp kit (using an Evergoods CAP2 for this) + a medicines kit (have a number of health issues, again, using a different CAP2 for this) + ideally my Birkenstocks (I wear Converses on my days off, business shoes for work naturally and nice dinners, and the Birkenstocks for little things like walking down the road to the local supermarket, or taking the laundry out to hang it up etc). But I can live without the Birkenstocks on trips, so it would be: wearing Converses with business shoes in the duffel. Naturally, laptop + power bank + most medicines (especially important for my Ritalin) + a book + cables + whatever else can go in my Evergoods 24L CPL. And then with my sling to take out each day to explore. So I am not sure whether to get the Patagonia or the North Face, in the 40 (Patagonia), 55L (Patagonia), or the North Face in S or M. Sadly, where I live, it is more or less impossible to see them in person before buying. I have the 55L Patagonia, as I said, and other than the colour/textile, the main things I don't like are: a) lack of internal organisation (not improved for the 2024 version I believe), and b) when not crammed full, it sags and lacks structure. I'm hoping this is a bag I can use for many years to come, and I'm just sick of having to use my suitcase all the time (just that it's big, chunky, obnoxious). For other types of travel I've got an Osprey backpack that I pair with my sling for exploring during the day. So yes, my questions are: 1. What size would be appropriate, given it will be largely for one to two week trips, with me not being great at packing smartly and minimally, with the options being 40L, 55L or 71L, but with the option of washing say once every 5-7 days?; and 2. Which brand/product is better - durability, cost, value, look, warranty etc? I will say - I love the ""look"" of the Patagonia, especially in the matte blue finish. Other than that, I'm open to jumping ship to the North Face, if needed. Final thing is the price - I can get the 40L Patagonia (new design) for $185 AUD, so \~$120 USD, I can get the 55L Patagonia (new design) for around $200 AUD, so \~$130 USD, and the North Face M for $175 AUD, so \~$115 USD. The North Face is therefore around $100 AUD cheaper than normal, meaning, $100 AUD cheaper than th",Explorer,The North Face,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1crlk66/north_face_base_camp_duffel_vs_patagonia_black/

The new entry by the company has managed to achieve excellence in gameplay, storytelling and technical aspects. In the end, Rockstar has been successful in pushing the franchise to its limits in order to create one of the most complete games of all time. -------------- **Atomix** - Alberto Desfassiaux - *Spanish* - [100 / 100](https://atomix.vg/review-red-dead-redemption-2/) &gt;Red Dead Redemption 2 survives the great expectations that were had of it, even far exceeding them in a way that is rarely seen within gaming. -------------- **Attack of the Fanboy** - William Schwartz - [5 / 5 stars](https://attackofthefanboy.com/reviews/red-dead-redemption-2-review/) &gt;With Red Dead Redemption 2 Rockstar Games has set the bar so high that other games of this nature seem infinitesimally lesser because of its existence. -------------- **AusGamers** - Steve Farrelly - [10 / 10.0](http://www.ausgamers.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2/review/) &gt;Rockstar, my dusty old hat is off to you.

It's all wrapped up in an immaculate presentation, told over dozens of hours and adventures that leads to an inevitable conclusion: Red Dead Redemption 2 raises the bar for the sandbox genre and stands tall as the definitive western game of this or any other generation. -------------- **Cubed3** - Tomas Barry - [9 / 10](http://www.cubed3.com/review/5158/1/red-dead-redemption-2-playstation-4.html) &gt;The first collaborative project between all of Rockstar Games' studios is something truly special. While no single element of Red Dead Redemption 2 is revolutionary, due to its ambitious scope, it's greater than the sum of its parts. Few single-player experiences excel simultaneously at telling a deep and poignant story, whilst also providing the player with such a huge extent of freedom and possibility. The universe is exceedingly broad, varied, and beautiful, not to mention overflowing with interesting characters, wildlife, and things to do. The sense of polish and finer details really bring things together, along with the excellent musical score, fantastic voice acting and the title's intense and visceral cinematic qualities. Fans of the original Red Dead Redemption will be enamoured by the sequel. It doesn't just accentuate the West, but animates it on a new level, with a greater sense of life, community, and narrative. It's epic. -------------- **Daily Dot** - Joseph Knoop - [4.5 / 5 stars](https://www.dailydo",Explorer,The North Face,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/9r98ko/red_dead_redemption_2_reviews_megathread/
"[BANNED/SHADOWBANNED?] Hard Reset Guide A **hard reset** is needed if you feel your account has been shadowbanned (getting zero likes for an extended time despite getting some before) or banned. If not, you can **soft reset** a limited amount of times, which entails simply deleting and recreating your account. This generic hard reset guide applies to Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge: 1. Delete your account (if you're banned, you won't be able to, in which case skip this step) 2. If on a device, uninstall the app 3. Create a new email address 4. Get a new number (or [use a service that will sent you a verification text, usually for under $5](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;q=tinder+verification+number)) 5. Edit your photos in some way to make them not the same photo, e.g. adding a pixel somewhere, cropping, and/or strip EXIF info, save with different filename (*note: there is some evidence that the apps are using image hash comparisons, which means you need to use completely different photos*). 6. Use a different IP address than when you created your account (e.g. use your phone internet or go to a public WiFi hotspot ‚Äî you can *probably* return to your original WiFi once the hard reset is successful) 7. Open your web browser or get a new device (cheap burner Androids are $30-40 on Swappa or eBay) * if you buy a new iPhone, you will need a new AppleID * if you plan to use your new phone on hotspot or wifi, you don't need a SIM card. 8. Create a new account with your new number and email address Other considerations: * Don't link old Instagram/Spotify etc. * Don't pay with the same card if buying premium services * Don't use a VPN. * Never do face verification unless you're forced to * You **don't** need to wait a certain period of time (like 90 days) if doing a hard reset * You can **never** log in to your new account from the device you got banned on, or you risk a ban ***""Do I really have to do every step?""*** or ***""I know someone who didn't use a new device or a new IP address and they still got through!""*** The way these apps likely detect banned users is by assigning each newly-created profile a risk score. The more you match the fingerprint of a banned user, the more likely you are to be banned. So yes, it's possible that someone can slip around a ban while not following all of this to the letter, but ideally you create a brand new fingerprint and don't have to rely on luck. ***""I followed the Hard Reset Guide and it didn't work!""*** Some users try the above steps and for whatever reason, it just doesn't work. We're not there alongside you making sure you did everything right, but even if you did, there's uncertainty around Match Group's detection algorithm. Hard resetting seems to have become much less reliable starting in early 2023. If a hard reset does not work and you truly believe you have been banned unfairly, there are three options: 1. Match Group have an arbitration process that can be kicked off by sending a letter to their legal department. See more in section 15 of the Terms of Service ([Hinge, for example](https://hinge.co/terms/)). 2. There is some evidence that [filing a complaint](https://www.bbb.org/us/tx/dallas/profile/online-dating-services/match-group-llc-0875-21002176/complaints) with the Better Business Bureau (must be a resident of North America) will cause the apps to take a closer look at your case; however, this is by no means a guarantee that you will be unbanned. 3. As of early 2024, in some situations, Hinge and Tinder have [ban appeal processes](https://hingeapp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061998734-How-can-I-appeal-my-ban). **If the Hard Reset Guide worked for you, help others out by posting a success story below!**",Explorer,The North Face,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/SwipeHelper/comments/sxyia6/bannedshadowbanned_hard_reset_guide/
"Buick finally had cars Americans wanted to buy - then came tariffs [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buick-finally-had-cars-americans-100252827.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buick-finally-had-cars-americans-100252827.html) DETROIT (Reuters) -General Motors‚Äô Buick was on a roll. Sales for the once-stodgy brand were up 39% in the first quarter with a refreshed lineup of compact SUVs including the Envision, Encore GX, and the Envista, its top-selling SUV for under $30,000. Then President Trump‚Äôs tariffs hit. Buick‚Äôs three most popular models are made outside the U.S. The Envista and Encore GX are both built in South Korea, while the Envision SUV is made in China. That means all three are now subject to stiff tariffs that could add thousands to sticker prices on dealer lots in the U.S. Buick‚Äôs South Korea-made models face a 27.5% tariff and the Envision out of China faces a steep 47.5% fee with a 25% auto tariff, a 20% China fentanyl tariff and a previously existing 2.5% auto tax, according to a Barclays analysis. It's bad news for Buick dealers, which have been thrilled by recent models by the brand that has for years struggled to shake off a stereotype that may no longer apply. Analysts believe higher prices could stall Buick‚Äôs momentum, and even threaten its survival. ""The latest wave of Buick vehicles is affordable, are good quality, are decent vehicles, and ruining that with a cost disadvantage could upset Buick as a going entity in the U.S.,"" said Sam Fiorani, vice president of research firm AutoForecast Solutions. Buick declined to comment for this story. RE-EVALUATING PORTFOLIOS Trump's tariffs are pushing auto executives to analyze their portfolios and evaluate if the costs are worth it in the long term to keep importing some foreign-made models. The tariffs, enacted earlier this month, have already led to some changes. GM moved to increase truck output at an Indiana plant and Stellantis, maker of Ram trucks and Jeeps, temporarily halted production at two plants in Mexico and in Canada. In a Tuesday, April 15 note, Barclays said it's assuming automakers ""will no longer sell vehicles that cannot be sold profitably,"" including vehicles imported from China and Korea as a result of auto tariffs. For GM specifically, Barclays expects the automaker will cease imports out of Korea and China of about 450,000 vehicles because of tariffs. Barclays is cutting its 2025 GM earnings before interest and taxes estimates by 40% based on lower volume and the gross tariff impact of about $9.5 billion. For its crosstown competitor Ford Motor, Barclays expects a 60% reduction with a gross tariff impact of about $7 billion. Ford ships its Lincoln Nautilus from China. Affordable vehicles like the Envista and Chevrolet Trax, both built in South Korea, stand to take the biggest hit from tariffs because automakers often build them outside the U.S. The impact on affordable vehicles is an industry-wide concern with the average transaction price of a new vehicle in the U.S. ""north of $48,000,"" according to research firm Cox Automotive, which expects tariffs will cause a 10% to 15% increase in prices of affected models, and an overall 5% jump in prices of vehicles not subject to the levies. STALLING THE NEW BUICK Buick's lineup has either been replaced or refreshed in the last 20 months leading to sales increases. The brand‚Äôs yearly sales in 2023 increased by 61% and by 10% in 2024, according to the company‚Äôs sales figures. The 2023 arrival of the Envista, a small SUV priced starting at $23,800, elevated the brand. New styling for the Envision, a compact SUV starting at $36,500, came last year, further amplifying it. ‚ÄúEnvision is the bestseller right now,‚Äù said Jeff Laethem, GMC and Buick dealer in Detroit. ‚ÄúOnce they put the Envista styling on it, that's when it took off.‚Äù Buick‚Äôs market share in the U.S. has jumped from 0.8% in 2022 to 1.1% in 2024 and 1.6% in the first quarter of 2025, according to data from Edmunds.com.

As in, those Mall Brands and ubiquitous wardrobe pieces we so often take for granted were co-opted by the fashion-fervent such that decades-old outlet sneakers were voted the best of the year and rich, beautiful internet models cosplayed as Joe Sixpack on some of the biggest platforms on the internet, to the extent that both sides of the fashion coin joined hands in irritated unison? That‚Äôs a loaded question. Let me crush it down to something simpler: What the hell is (was) Normcore? # Fashion Styles: A crash course Styles, in the sense of personal fashion, are so numerous and technical at this point that the very outfit you‚Äôre wearing right now could inadvertently be considered one you‚Äôve never heard of. The internet has only increased the speed at which these movements take wing. While throwing the words Fashion and Style and Trend in the same sentence may evoke embarrassing memories of teen magazines, the conceit of theming one‚Äôs wardrobe to one‚Äôs personal ethos is understandable and universal. Your clothes aren‚Äôt just what you own, they‚Äôre reflections of who you are (remember this). To that end, style begets community, identity, self-discovery, and monthly bank statements you try your best not to look at as you stuff it under a mountain of papers. Or maybe your style isn‚Äôt that deep, doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúreflect who you are,‚Äù and the satisfaction you get out of fit pics is uncomplicated, aesthetic pleasure. I‚Äôd say the most popular style of the modern era would have to be [Streetwear](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/32/8c/fb/328cfbe520f91e8dc1d9b1446a1468cb.jpg), which combines basically every counter-culture movement around the world into a unified voice that either [whispers](https://i.pinimg.com/236x/23/42/30/234230abd91c15c473ced76885172380.jpg) or [screams](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5bb7fc06ab1a62666096952b/1546718370928-Z3CB5ZKSBW98CCTNHZRH/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kGeNtXjnSVE0FC98ofHjoQx7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UVURxIstYj4VcQ3u4G8psS8p19-2HRX2fy4mVTF2-S9JlPRhrjbf-ufqwsSWgrw9rg/asspizza-blog16-1.jpg?format=1500w) depending on the taste of its wearer.

"What snowboard brands are still privately owned? This question crossed my mind recently and I started doing some googling and I was surprised to learn that some of my favorite ""core"" brands are actually owned by giant investment firms or corporations. In general, as a lover of this sport, I want to support the smaller, rider owned and operated brands with my dollar when it comes time to buy new gear. Take Volcom for example. Volcom is a brand I always considered ""core"" and cool with a rad team, but they're actually owned by Authentic Brands, which [now owns the Boardriders](https://thedaily.outdoorretailer.com/news/brands-and-retailers/authentic-brands-closes-boardriders-acquisition/#:~:text=The%20New%20York%2Dbased%20brand,to%20a%20licensing%20operating%20model) group (Quicksilver, Roxy, DC, Billabong, plus a few others). This now puts Volcom and Quicksilver next to brands like David Beckham, Frye, Forever 21, Izod, Nautica, and Spyder. [Link to Authentic Brands' portfolio](https://corporate.authentic.com/brands) Another example, Mervin. I always thought of Lib and Gnu as rad, independent, rider owned brands but no. Apparently (according to [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mervin_Manufacturing#:~:text=Mervin%20was%20purchased%20by%20Quiksilver,was%20purchased%20by%20Altamont%20Capital)) they were bought by Quicksilver in the late 90s, and by Altamont Capital in 2014. Colored me surprised. I found this pretty funny, especially after T Ricky's That's it That's All part where the Lib logo is peeing on a Burton logo, when Burton is actually still privately owned. So final example is Burton, which I know is still privately owned. Say what you will about them being ""core"" or not, but I think the fact they've chosen to stay private is rad and a positive for our industry. I personally think they have deservedly lost a lot of respect from the community with various moves like buying up brands to drop them later, *cough* *Forum* *cough,* but they do continue to invest in putting out solid products and supporting rad riders. Anyways, I'm just wondering if anyone has a solid list of who is still privately (and ideally rider) owned in the snowboard industry. I managed to find a 12 yr old [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/snowboarding/comments/m4di1/snowboarding_who_owns_who_jpg/) that linked to a cool [info graphic](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Q5GWc46SESE/S118yx6JbgI/AAAAAAAAB3w/4qn2AchkQzg/s1600-h/Brand-Map.jpg) and I would love to see a current version of this. EDIT: To the best of my knowledge, these are the brands I believe are still privately owned (I'll try to keep this updated): * 1910 * 686 * Academy * Aesmo (Is Wolfgang independent of Salomon??) * Airblaster * Amplid * Ashbury * Beyond Medals * Bluebird Wax * Bombhole * Borealis Snowboards * Burton * C3 * Capita * Coal * Union * Cardiff Snowcraft * Chimera Snowboards * Coiler Custom Alpine Snowboards * Crab Grab * Custom Cult snowboards * Damaged Inc. * Dang Shades * Deviation Works * Dinosaurs Will Die * Donek * D.O.P.E Industries (the swaggy homies from up north, not that lame insta brand) * Douk Snowboards * DRIFT boards * Drink Sexy (shout out for the cooked homies) * Dupraz Snowboards * Elevated Surf Craft * Endeavor Snowboards * Gilson * Glade Optics * Goon Gear * FlameTec * FLUX bindings * Franco Snowshapes * Friday Snowboard Co. * Fuberg Snowboards * Gentemstick * Howl * Karakoram * Kemper (relaunched in 2018 by a rider - [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kemper_Snowboards)) * Killdeath * KNWN Mfg * Korua Shapes * Lago Snowboards * Marhar * Moonchild Snowboards * Moron Wax * Moss Snowstick * MTN Approach * MTN Local Snowboards * Nerd Snowboards * Never Summer * NICHE * Nidecker Group * Flow * Jones * Nidecker * Now * YES * Low Pressure Studios [link to acquisition article](https://www.boardsportsource.com/big-wig-interview-nidecker-brothers-make-major-acquisition-moves/) * Bataleon * Lobster * Switchback * Rome SDS * Nitro * Autumn * Corduroy * Eivy * L1 Premiu",Explorer,The North Face,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/snowboarding/comments/17hyqdu/what_snowboard_brands_are_still_privately_owned/
"Trip Report: Tunis - Regrettably, one to-miss I just spent the last ten days working from the Tunisian capital. I'd always been mildly curious about it. A more liberal-leaning culture than some of its Arab peers, only a short hop from Europe, with some appealing autumn weather. I'd visited North Africa for a road trip through Southern Morocco about ten years ago so had a vague idea of what to expect. I enjoyed that experience as a holiday but it never struck me as somewhere I'd opt to work from. I thought I'd challenge these assumptions with a few short city visits in the region, with Tunis the first stop. I usually book a month in places but I had sufficient reservations about Tunis that 10 nights felt like a safe amount to test the waters. There's a few fundamental reasons why I won't go back and likely explain why it's never developed into a more popular remote work destination. I don‚Äôt like tearing into a destination, especially one which is in unquestionably part of the developing world. I can already foresee the comments of ‚Äú*What did you expect?!*‚Äù. I couldn‚Äôt find a glut of information prior to the trip so I‚Äôll endeavour to be as detailed as possible, which may be useful if you‚Äôre eyeing it up as somewhere to visit. # Main negatives: **The trash.** I am no eco-warrior. I am unperturbed by most displays of litter and waste. But what I saw across Tunis genuinely shocked me. Trash is *everywhere*. This is not just a couple of crisp packets on the street. Industrial-scale fly-tipping of residential and commercial waste is rampant. The issue actually gets worse as you leave the city centre and more open spaces emerge. This isn't a problem confined to certain neighbourhoods but a pervasive part of even the areas deemed to be more upmarket such as Le Marsa and Sidi Bou Said. The issue apparently stems from a lack of government funding for proper waste disposal, but it feels like it has resulted in a wider societal acceptance of using any open space as a dumping ground. Residential areas, parks and transit stations all become fair game. I can't recall seeing anything like it, rivalled only by my experience in India 15 years ago. Areas which have potential to be scenic outdoor spots like Belvedere Park, just north of the downtown, or the coastline near Corniche Lac 2, end up resembling waste disposal facilities. **The structure of the city.** A lot of guidance for conventional tourists visiting Tunis will suggest staying in one of the coastal districts outside of the downtown itself. I followed this and opted for the area of Sidi Bou Said. The downtown was almost exactly as I envisaged. You've got the ancient Medina, one quite nicely landscaped main boulevard, and then streets peeling off it in various states of decay. For comparison, no area in the downtown really felt like it gets close to what you may expect from an urban setting in Europe. The streets are gritty, the building stock is generally tired and distressed. It has a certain charm to it. I visited three times during my stint and particularly enjoyed bouncing around small smoke-filled sports bars watching the afternoon football with a local beer. There's even a surprisingly good rooftop bar which feels like it could come straight out of East London. But I'm confident that for most people it's not an urban environment you'd be too excited about basing yourself in for an entire month. The guidance to be in the coastal areas does make sense. By car they are around a 20km trip. The main issue I found is that La Marsa just isn't that great as somewhere to work from. It's billed as more of an upmarket, beachside town, and whilst it might be by local or national standards, it didn't feel that significantly different. There is a train line connecting it to the centre, passing through Sidi Bou Said and Carthage but I saw no evidence of the train running throughout my stay. On the first day I attempted to get a ticket and a man swiftly redirected me to the bus station.

"As Black History Month comes to a close her in the US, I wanted to share an EXPANDED collection of stories that feature black or African American people who stories are unresolved in some way In observance of Black History month, I wanted to share a collection of stories that feature black or African American people who stories are unresolved in some way. I posted this piece last year and sadly there were few updates to provide, with the only major regarding the case of Toni Clark. Most of these pieces below are my own write ups, but some are written by others. If you know of any other stories please feel free to share them in the comments section below. Hopefully, some awareness can be brought to these lesser known cases. **Teekah Lewis**, a two year old girl went missing from a Tacoma, Washington bowling alley in 1999. Her case, which is classified as a stranger abduction, is still unsolved. Teekah is described as a Multiracial female with black hair, brown eyes. Teekah is of African-American, Caucasian and Native American descent. Her mother is Caucasian and Chippewa while her father is African American. She has a large birthmark on her left buttock and red natural highlights in her hair. She has patches of light discoloration on her face and the left side of her buttocks as the result of eczema. Teekah has facial dimples, and pierced ears. Some reports say that Teekah had a silver streak on the right front section of her hair. It is unclear if this was a dyed section or a natural section of gray hair, although I would assume it was natural. She was wearing a green Tweety Bird sweatshirt or t-shirt, white sweatpants and black and white Air Jordan sneakers, with her hair pulled into ponytails. She was carrying a clear purse with a fish design, containing Starburst candies. Teekah had eczema and also suffered from asthma at the time she went missing. She used an inhaler. Teekah is described as a shy mama‚Äôs girl who loved Pooh bear and eating starburst candy. It is believed that Teekah was abducted by a white male in his 30s. He had a large nose, a pockmarked face, and shoulder length wavy or curly brown hair. He was wearing a blue checkered flannel shirt and blue jeans and drove a dark colored late 80s or early 90s model Pontiac Grand Am.

"WORKING AT DISNEY Ah...the magical world of Disney. So much goes on ""offstage"" and ""behind the scenes"" to ensure that the guests have ""the most magical times of their lives"" once they arrive on the property. Ever seen a wet paint sign while walking through the parks? How about a maintenance cast member with a bag of tools? Anyone with a construction hard hat? Of course you haven't. That would ruin the expierience that WDW is perfection. It's because that 99.99% of all work goes on after the show is over. All the little ""mice"" that keep the place running like clockwork don't even start working until the announcement is made over the radios we carry that ""The Park Is Now Clear!"". Then the crews get to work. Maintenance starts buzzing around on their golf carts, the custodial cast members bring out the large hoses to wash down every inch of the streets we all walk on, and the construction crews are allowed past the security perimeter gates to come in and do whatever needs to be done. That's where my story begins. I've worked construction most of my life. When work dried up up North, I moved to Florida where some of my family had moved over ten years ago. Naturally, I needed to find a job. I wound up applying for and getting hired by a construction company that shall remain nameless that literally did almost all of the construction needs for ""The Coorporate Mouse"". I spent five or six overnights a week at various locations at WDW with coworkers (we weren't employed by Disney hence we were not ""Cast Members"") doing whatever our foreman told us what needed to be done. Sweet gig actually, even though it was very hard work at times. Just think...how many people can truly say the get to ride around Magic Kingdom, Animal Kingdom, etc in the dead of night in trucks, golf carts, what have you while the park is just about empty except for a skeleton crew? For about the first six months, I kind of kept to myself except for talking with the crew of the company that I worked for. Then I began noticing how chummy many of the Disney overnight crew was with our staff. Custodians, when working in the same areas as us would come and talk to the boys as well as the overnight security cast members. I began to slowly get to know many of these folks as well. They, for the most part, were really nice. I got to know many of the night security staff (by face at least) at all four parks as well as the resorts. If you didn't know, WDW opened in 1971. It was actually not too uncommon to come across someone who had been a ""lifer"" with Disney or knew someone who was. Forty plus years working for the Mouse...God bless 'em. Even my foreman, who although did not work directly for WDW, was one of these. Boy...did they have some stories to tell to pass the time. As I adjusted more to the job, I began to get more comfortable with the surroundings. The cast members grew more social towards me, and I was able to make my way through the parks without getting lost too. Let me tell you, that is not an easy feat when you first start out working there. Especially at night. Although it's not PITCH black, there is very minimal lighting except where we put our floodlights up to do work. Security is only using flashlights or the headlight of their carts to light their ways, and store lights are only on if someone is working in them. Quite eerie and yet cool at the same time. It's like a totally different place than during operating hours. As a matter of fact, one time when I decided to visit the park as a guest, I couldn't find a ride that I wanted to go on because it looked so different during the day with all the colors, people, sounds, and music. One year of working at the place full time and I had to swallow my stupid pride and go get a map. Ha ha...pathetic. Anyway, as I started conversing more and more with the Cast Members, some of the security staff and I found out that we had a mutual intrest in the paranormal (of course that would come up in coversation eventually w",Explorer,The North Face,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/25be39/working_at_disney/

Ace is nonbinary, and everyone they know has called them by their chosen, gender-neutral name, since they were 9. ‚ÄúI was a very, like, pretty pink princess little child, but I don't think I ever really wanted to be a girl,‚Äù Ace said. ‚ÄúIt didn't fit.‚Äù Ace‚Äôs preference is for their pronouns to be switched between she and they, but they said they‚Äôre used to being called she. ‚ÄúI live in Texas, so I don't exactly expect that much,‚Äù Ace said. But, this year, their teachers have been told they can no longer call Ace by their chosen name. And that‚Äôs really getting under their skin. Names and pronouns In August, Ace‚Äôs school district, North East Independent School District in San Antonio, told employees that because of Senate Bill 12, they can only call students by names and pronouns that match the sex listed on their birth certificate. For Ace, that means some teachers avoid calling them anything at all. ‚ÄúThey'll be like, ‚ÄòIt's either your last name or I just don't call on you.‚Äô Or, like, ‚ÄòIf I need you, I'll point at you.‚Äô So, in certain classes, I'm just on high alert, because I don't know what the teacher will be feeling that day,‚Äù Ace said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really dehumanizing.‚Äù North East ISD Superintendent Sean Maika said the district is just trying to follow the law. ‚ÄúThese aren't things that we're saying. We're following the law,‚Äù Maika said. ‚ÄúOftentimes I've referred to it as the perfect crime, because a law has been passed and it looks like our fingerprints are all over it, but we're just following the law.‚Äù Maika said the district issued guidance on pronouns and names in order to protect their staff. Another new law makes it easier for parents to sue teachers and librarians. ‚ÄúThe parent could sue them. ‚Ä¶ And then sanction their certification, and all sorts of things. So, there's some pretty big consequences to that,‚Äù Maika said. North East is basing its guidance on names on a section of SB 12 that bans school employees from assisting with social transitioning. But Ace‚Äôs mom, Mara, said that‚Äôs not what teachers would be doing if they called Ace by their name. ‚ÄúThe truth of the matter is, I don't think of my child as transitioning,‚Äù Mara said. ‚ÄúTheir identity is established.‚Äù As Mara spoke, Ace struck a pose, with their hands framing their face, as if to say ‚ÄúTa-da.‚Äù ‚ÄúMom, I‚Äôm not a girl,‚Äù Ace joked, as if it were brand new information. Parents' rights Supporters of SB 12 say it gives parents more rights. In a statement earlier this year, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said the law ""reasserts parents as the primary decision-makers in their child‚Äôs public school education by eliminating discriminatory Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion ideology in public schools.‚Äù But Mara said that doesn‚Äôt match her experience. ‚ÄúThis isn't about parent rights, because nobody asked me, and I'm the parent,‚Äù Mara said. ‚ÄúAnd it's not about making it easier for teachers, because the teachers are apologizing to the students.‚Äù North East says their staff can‚Äôt call Ace by their chosen name even with Mara‚Äôs permission. Attorney Brian Klosterboer with the ACLU of Texas questions that position. ‚ÄúThat is nowhere to be seen in the law itself, but because the socia",Explorer,The North Face,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/SanAntonioUSA/comments/1nbtiuc/lgbtq_san_antonio_teens_describe_dehumanizing/
"Absolutely do not understand the ‚Äúhate‚Äù for the Samsung S90D - got mine delivered today and just finished hanging it‚Ä¶I feel like I‚Äôve never watched TV or a movie before PRE-EDIT: the hate I‚Äôm referring to is on the 4ktv subreddit‚Ä¶where they removed this post twice (first time as spam for linking to another subreddit where I found the deal‚Ä¶that isn‚Äôt even available anymore anyway, so I removed that link entirely, wrote what‚Äôs below, it was human reviewed and removed again but without even offering a reason). Anyway‚Ä¶on to the post lol I‚Äôm coming from a 65‚Äù TCL 4 series 4k UHD HDR LED tv. This may be part of why I‚Äôm so thrilled, as it‚Äôs admittedly not a great TV. That said, it died (one of the backlight LEDs burned out). I had a 55‚Äù variant of it in storage and used that as a ‚Äústop gap‚Äù while I researched‚Ä¶and waited (about 1.5 months). I ended up getting the 65‚Äù QD-OLED S90D for $958 brand new after seeing this post back on the 31st of August: (can‚Äôt post the actual link even though it‚Äôs just to the buildapcpartsales subreddit, was removed as spam the first time). Long story short, was a link to an authorized retailer on eBay that was running a sale on them brand new, and simultaneously eBay was offering a 20% coupon separately for anything on eBay). so I got the 1 year warranty through the manufacturer and bought it with a credit card I keep paid off and use exclusively for electronics purchases (adds an additional five years to the manufacturers warranty). My use cases are movies/TV from an entirely self curated Plex library, nearly all which is HDR/HDR10/HDR10+, along with some sports consumed via an HD IPTV provider (and my HDhomerun for local news sports). All of the above are consumed exclusively through the Plex interface. Reason for the almost exclusively HDR variant content is the TV I‚Äôm coming from also didn‚Äôt support Dolby vision but did support HDR. What‚Äôs funny now that I‚Äôm watching this new TV, Id swear the old TV didn‚Äôt even support HDR. It‚Äôs a laughable difference on the new set. All of the above said‚Ä¶the picture is absolutely ridiculous. I followed rtings.com setup for picture settings and when my wife came home and I ‚Äúdemo‚Äôd‚Äù it for her, she was legit slack jawed.

That said, with the TCL roku TV we‚Äôd have to keep the blinds and curtains closed entirely or you really couldn‚Äôt see the picture. This TV, literally can‚Äôt even notice the windows, even with the blinds and curtains fully open in the middle of the day (unless it‚Äôs an all or mostly black scene). The colors, the vibrancy, even the ‚Äúupscaler‚Äù for my local news is astounding. I‚Äôm just really super happy with it and figured I‚Äôd share.

I have been wanting to do this work for years, so my dream has come true. --Why did you choose the Azuchi-Momoyama period as the setting for this work? **KARL**: I chose it because it is a very rich period in history. It was a time of war and political maneuvering, a time of change from rural to urban areas, and also the birth of art. I also chose it because it was the start of the unification of Japan. It was a pivotal moment for Japan. Together, these elements provided an excellent canvas on which to tell the story. --What kind of image do you have of the Azuchi-Momoyama period? **KARL**: This was a time when the feudal lords of the warring states were fighting for power in the name of unifying the country, but it was also a struggle for control of trade. Portuguese missionaries and merchants came to Japan together. The Portuguese missionaries and merchants came to Japan together, and people who wanted a beautiful country and peace. This is the kind of image we have, but I think there was a mixture of various cultures and people's thoughts. And of course, there were the warring feudal lords. These are great canvases for the story. --What do you think should be inherited from ""Assassin's Creed"" and what are the unique aspects of this game? **KARL**: When people think of ""Assassin's Creed,"" they think of stealth, but shinobi fantasy is not only a perfect fit for an ""Assassin's Creed"" game, it also fits the DNA of the ""Assassin"" brand. What we wanted to do with ""Assassin's Creed Shadows"" was to push stealth even further. We started this effort with the previous game, ""Assassin's Creed Mirage,"" but we wanted to take it further with new features. Systems such as light and shadow, grappling ropes, prone, and a variety of tools available in the game provide a new experience. The gameplay is also enriched by two characters, Naoe, a shinobi, and Yasuke, a samurai. Players will explore and discover Japan through the eyes of Naoe, a local, and one non-Japanese outsider. The game is more dynamic than ever before, pushing the limits of technology and offering an experience exclusive to current-gen consoles. --The ""Assassin's Creed: Valhalla,"" released in 2020, is based on the theme of ""Vikings"" and has been a huge sales success. As a Japanese, I feel that from a global perspective, the Japanese ""shinobi"" theme is even more niche, but what is your current response? **KARL**: I would like to talk about how it compares to ""Viking"" fantasy. Both shinobi and samurai are exciting and celebrated as fantasy with power, and are widely discussed in pop culture, and we are very much inspired by them. Shinobi were on our radar from the beginning because we thought they fit well with the ""Assassins"" brand, but we felt that incorporating a powerful samurai would create two different gameplay experiences and give us the opportunity to tell the story from two different perspectives. We feel that this is a powerful motif that can compete with the ""Viking"" motif. --How did you like the setting of Japan as a subject matter for the latest model? **KARL**: I think it was perfect. For example, the ""Global Illumination"" technology allowed us to explore the response of light and shadow. Some consoles are still called ""Baked GI"", but by using dynamic lighting and the power of the new hardware, we were able to explore the creativity. We are now able to express not only light and shadow, but also ",Explorer,The North Face,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1cvv1mr/exclusive_interview_with_famitsu_and_the_devs/

"[WWE/Professional Wrestling] The People versus Roman Reigns Professional wrestling has a very insular, misunderstood and (in Daniel Bryan's words) fickle fanbase that is also chock-full of assholes at every level. A lot of the drama that springs up here is very dense and emotion-driven, as well as being incomprehensible to most outsiders. I'm gonna try my best to keep the tangents and insider wrestling jargon to a minimum here, so feel free to comment about any parts you don't understand. I'm also recalling a ton of this from memory, so bear with me. **A Quick Glossary:** WWE - World Wrestling Entertainment, formerly the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). For the purposes of this post I may refer to WWE/WWF interchangeably. Kayfabe - wrestling lingo for ""in universe"", the overall masquerade that dictates all the onscreen action/drama is ""real"" and the wrestlers are the characters they're playing. Babyface - the ""good guy"" or hero in a story. Also called a ""Face"" for short. Heel - the ""bad guy"" or villain. Conventional wisdom in the industry often dictates that heels are more interesting characters than faces. Because wrestling. Heel turn - a good guy turns evil and becomes a heel. Despite the above conventional wisdom, this is *not* always a good thing. Face turn - a bad guy turns good and becomes a babyface. Smark - shorthand for a hardcore wrestling fan, for the purposes of this post. A portmanteau of ""smart mark"", which has elaborate carny roots I won't go into here. #Introduction The central conceit of professional wrestling is guys doing a mostly-convincing performance of beating each other up, often against the backdrop of a wider feud or narrative spanning months or even years at a time. Think MMA, but less boring and with soap opera dramatics. And like any other soap opera, wrestling had its designated heroes (babyfaces) and villains (heels). Let's get one thing out of the way: WWE is the biggest wrestling company in the world, and you'll be hard-pressed to find a wrestling fan who hasn't heard of some version of it. WWE is also synonymous with wrestling itself to most (but not all) lay people across the world. WWE's biggest storylines play out on one of two weekly TV programs: Monday Night Raw, and Smackdown Live. (WWE's third major weekly show, NXT, is a whole other messy story that merits an entire post of its own.) WWE also has monthly pay-per-view shows - think Wrestlemania or the Royal Rumble - which often serve as the ""climax"" to a given short- or long-term feud. There are generally three types of viewer attitudes towards the overall brand: * Type 1: casual fans (""marks"") who believe **WWE is the center of the wrestling universe**; * Type 2: more ""involved"" hardcore fans (""smarks"") who know that **WWE is just one wrestling company out of many**, each with its own style and ethos. However, due to the nature of wrestling and the [controversial history](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_WWE) of how WWE became the industry leader in the first place, there is significant overlap between Type 2 and * Type 3: **WWE is evil**, in the classic ""Big Bad Monopolistic Multimillion-Dollar Corporation"" sense that embodied everything wrong with capitalism. So... what does all of this have to do with Roman Reigns? #The WWE Ideal There are certain ""fan myths"" that have been built around wrestling over the years, WWE in particular. Some are more true than others. A common one is that WWE has terrible storylines, and that they're incompetent at writing babyfaces. One of the most pervasive myths (of many) however revolves around Vince McMahon, WWE's longtime CEO (and occasional onscreen villain) who also had the final say in most canonical feuds and storylines behind the scenes. According to most smarks, Vince McMahon is a size queen. Which is to say he favors ""larger than life"" wrestlers built like bodybuilders with a bombastic personality to match. Think Hulk Hogan or The Rock or John Cena: they're the epitome of Vince's d",Explorer,The North Face,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/lzpat4/wweprofessional_wrestling_the_people_versus_roman/
"NYT: How Kamala Harris Burned Through $1.5 Billion in 15 Weeks - Her frenzied spending has led to second-guessing among some Democrats and questions as she has pressed for more cash since the election. Vice President Kamala Harris spent a remarkable $1.5 billion in her hyper-compressed 15-week presidential campaign. But in the days since losing to President-elect Donald J. Trump, her operation has faced questions internally and externally over where exactly all that cash went. Despite her significant financial advantage, Ms. Harris became the first Democratic presidential candidate to lose the national popular vote in two decades, ceding every battleground state to Mr. Trump. Her cash-rich campaign spared no expense as it hunted for voters ‚Äî paying for an avalanche of advertising, social-media influencers, a for-hire door-knocking operation, thousands of staff, pricey rallies, a splashy Oprah town hall, celebrity concerts and even drone shows. It was a spree that averaged roughly $100 million per week. The frenzied spending has led to second-guessing among some Democrats, including whether investing in celebrity-fueled events with stars such as Lady Gaga and Beyonc√© was more ostentatious than effective. Since her loss, the Harris operation has pressed supporters for more cash with desperate-sounding solicitations, stirring fears about post-election debts. ‚ÄúIs there anything we can say?‚Äù came one email asking for cash last Monday. The biggest expense during the race was advertising. Between July 21 and Oct. 16, financial records show that the Harris campaign spent $494 million on producing and buying media, a category that includes both television and digital ads. The total sum through the election is said to be closer to $600 million. Yet starting in October, her campaign was actually narrowly outspent on broadcast television by Mr. Trump, according to data from the ad-tracking service AdImpact. The ads were just one piece of a campaign that had enough cash to spend on seemingly everything. There was $2.5 million directed toward three digital agencies that work with online influencers, records show. The campaign spent around $900,000 to book advertising on the exterior of the Sphere venue in Las Vegas in the last week of the race, two officials said. There were drone shows in the sky before the debate in Philadelphia in September and at a Pittsburgh Steelers game in October. In a note on Friday to Ms. Harris‚Äôs top fund-raisers, Chris Korge, the Democratic National Committee‚Äôs finance chair, said that losing all seven battleground states had ‚Äúshocked us all.‚Äù ‚ÄúI will absolutely push for an introspective study and analysis of the campaign, its structure, its messaging, all communication platforms and budgeting,‚Äù Mr. Korge wrote. Given the magnitude of Ms. Harris‚Äôs loss, more of the focus so far has been on the Democratic brand and message rather than the mechanics of her operation. Ms. Harris inherited a campaign based in inconvenient Wilmington, Del., that was built for President Biden, and she had limited time to refashion it to better suit her strengths. Ms. Harris added some senior advisers but mostly kept the Biden team in place, including Jennifer O‚ÄôMalley Dillon, the powerful campaign chair who oversaw the finances and virtually every major move. Jennifer O‚ÄôMalley Dillon was part of the Biden team that stayed on after Ms. Harris rose to the top of the Democratic ticket. As campaign chair, she oversaw the finances and virtually every major move.Erin Schaff/The New York Times The campaign‚Äôs spending decisions were documented in Federal Election Commission records and interviews with 15 Harris campaign officials and close allies, most of whom insisted on anonymity to discuss internal finances and dynamics candidly.

"[Competitive Team Fortress 2] How a reigning world champion pissed off almost the entire European competitive community #**Preface** This is my first foray into writing down hobby drama! I had a lot of fun looking back on when I used to play this game competitively (although I've been inactive since about 2016). I'm sure someone from the competitive TF2 scene will eventually see this post -- if there's anything I get incorrect, please let me know. --- #**An introduction to competitive Team Fortress 2** Team Fortress 2 (TF2) is a multiplayer first-person shooter game that was released in 2007 by Valve -- a company also famous for games like Half-Life, Counter-Strike, and Portal. The game has nine different and distinct ‚Äúclasses‚Äù -- basically characters which do different things. The Scout is a fast-moving glass cannon that carries a shotgun, Soldier walks slowly but carries a rocket launcher which can allow him to move super quickly‚Ä¶ so on and so forth. You don‚Äôt need to have an encyclopedic knowledge of all the classes to understand the story, so I‚Äôll spare you the details. Though Team Fortress 2 was a massive success for casual players, it had a pretty small competitive community. Even at its peak back in 2010 or so, it was still niche. Big sponsors eventually started exiting the scene, as did many players. A decent portion of top-level players still kept grinding the game out of passion, but even that eventually died down as many players moved on. The community was akin to a small town: everyone knew everyone -- this was especially true around the time of this story (2016). To this day, the competitive TF2 scene still remains, small as it is. There's quite a bit of depth to the metagame of competitive TF2, but, for the sake of simplicity, I‚Äôll only mention the important things. The main competitive mode played in Team Fortress 2 is a six versus six format and is primarily composed four of the nine classes -- two Scouts, two Soldiers, a Demoman, and a Medic. The community pretty quickly reached the conclusion that the game is most fun when played like this. The other five classes are still played from time to time, but, again, that‚Äôs not exactly important to the drama. If you‚Äôre interested in the history of competitive TF2, I recommend checking out this super neat presentation [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLRhmad9Jq4) that was done by a former high-level player back in 2015. It goes pretty in-depth. Because only four classes are used regularly, most players generally specialize on one class in order to hone their skills. For instance, you probably won‚Äôt see the player Kaidus on anything except Demoman, you probably won‚Äôt see Clockwork on anything except Scout, etc. However, there is one notable exception: a player named b4nny. --- #**Who is b4nny?** b4nny, real name Grant Vincent, is one of the few ‚Äúold-guard‚Äù players who still actively competed in TF2 during the time of this story. He started playing on an amateur team as Demoman in mid-2009 but quickly rose to the highest level of play. After only about a year and a half of competing, b4nny won his first championship in late 2010 against the best in North America. And he would continue his winning ways. From 2010 to 2016, b4nny would finish first place in **28** different events, including 2 world championships and 8 regional championships. One thing that‚Äôs also unique to b4nny is that he has won top events on three of the four main competitive classes at the highest level -- Scout, Soldier, and Demoman. No other player, to my knowledge, has ever accomplished this. In the earlier days of his career, not too much wasn‚Äôt known about b4nny. Most people just knew him as this quiet guy who had long hair and was insane at playing Demoman. These qualities gave b4nny the nickname [‚ÄúPipe Jesus‚Äù](https://i.imgur.com/DyW78g5.png) by the community -- with ‚Äúpipes‚Äù referring to the grenades that the Demoman used.

Black Ops 6 will launch with two brand-new Round-Based Zombie maps ‚Äì Terminus and Liberty Falls ‚Äì and a continuation of the intriguing and terrifying Dark Aether narrative that was started in Black Ops Cold War. Hordes of the undead are set to rampage through these brand-new locations, each offering countless hours of fast-paced action where power-ups are plentiful, but you‚Äôre never more than a few seconds away from being overwhelmed and devoured! For newcomers, Zombies is Treyarch‚Äôs unique take on a cooperative player experience where you face off against vast mobs of zombified creatures, with the bulk being the recently deceased, now animated due to strange, eldritch forces. Expect every location you visit to be packed with powerful weapons, new and returning power-ups, a pantheon of revolting entities to face, and a host of secrets and easter eggs to discover. Remember too, that many of the previously revealed innovations in movement, visual fidelity, audio, and weapons will all be coming to Zombies as well.

Based off new leaks, this may not be the case but we have no clue. # TERMINUS **Map's Description(***MrDalekJD):* Terminus is called in-lore ""Blacksite 13"". There appears to be several divide sections of the map including the main prison as well as maze like elevated platforms. * The Easter egg/story implications of this map is to break out characters from prison.

We're currently crowdfunding to make this happen! &gt;Nestled in the hills and trees of the north of England is a tiny town, invisible to passing hikers and planes flying overhead. **Twelvelms is part of a secret world just out of sight** of the one we all live in; a dangerous magical world full of curses and spells beyond our imagination, and hidden histories which loop and twist like the knotted roots of ancient trees. This is the world of the mages, people who can use magic to perform wondrous acts of power and majesty, and for hundreds of years, they‚Äôve lived in secret on the fringes of our society. &gt; &gt;Twelvelms is a university town, sprung up around an ancient institution which for over a millennium has moulded the minds of the future of magedom.

But there is more to Twelvelms‚Äô hallowed halls than prestige and learning. It‚Äôs the centre of **a rotten conspiracy** which runs deep into the roots of magical society, and there‚Äôs only a matter time before the decay will spread into everything they know.

"DON'T Ask Your Doctor if Smilatrex‚Ñ¢ is Right For You! The woman entered my office uninvited. Maggie was sick at home or she would have sent her on her way. But then again, I got the feeling even Maggie couldn‚Äôt have refused this woman. She had a look of determination in her icy-blue eyes. Her short, ash-blonde hair was swept up to the side stylishly, and she carried an oversized bag with her. Immediately, I recognized what she was. I‚Äôd seen enough of her kind in my time. A pharmaceutical rep. ‚ÄúDoctor Balm,‚Äù she said, reaching out her hand. I took it and gave it a polite shake. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Lisa from Rendexx Pharmaceuticals. We‚Äôve been trying to reach you by telephone but never quite managed to connect.‚Äù Probably because my secretary has been doing her job, I thought to myself. She always screened those sorts of calls. I had no interest in being a shill for a drug company. ‚ÄúMy apologies,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWhat can I do for you?‚Äù She set her large black bag on the reception counter next to where we were standing and began to pull out sample packets and brochures. The phone began to ring loudly at the desk. I wanted to answer it but the woman had already begun her pitch. ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs just it, Doctor Balm. It‚Äôs not about what you can do for us, but what we can do for your patients.‚Äù Here we go, I thought. She opened up a brochure and began to show me details from inside its glossy pages, speaking persuasively enough that I listened instead of immediately sending her on her way, as I usually did. She was an extremely good saleswoman. ‚ÄúOur newest drug, Smilatrex, has just been accepted for approval by the FDA. It‚Äôs an absolute game-changer. Effective for depression, anxiety, even thoughts of self harm can be allayed by its formula. This is the next generation we‚Äôre talking about. This drug, by itself, is going to completely replace SSRIs and benzos in the next few years. All the benefits without the harmful side effects and dependencies. Not only that, but instead of taking months to begin working, as is the case with most SSRIs, Smilatrex begins its effects almost immediately.‚Äù ‚ÄúThose are some very bold claims.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo, you can see why we‚Äôve been trying so hard to reach you, to talk to you about it,‚Äù she said with an undeterred smile. I picked up one of the sample boxes and examined it. The packaging looked like any other drug - a pale purple colour with yellow butterflies all over it - the company‚Äôs brand name stamped upon it in bold letters. ‚ÄúRendexx Pharmaceuticals? How come I‚Äôve never heard of you guys?‚Äù ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre a German company. New to North America. But we‚Äôre going to make a big splash in the western markets. I‚Äôd tell you to start investing now but I‚Äôm sure you don‚Äôt play the stock market.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt. And I don‚Äôt usually speak to pharmaceutical reps either, if I'm being entirely honest. But if even half your claims are true...."" ""They're all true,"" she replied, her teeth fixed firmly in that unstoppable grin. ""Leave the sample packets. I'll do some research and think about it. How‚Äôs that?‚Äù She stuck out her hand for another shake and I took it reluctantly. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all I can ask for, Doctor. I won‚Äôt take up anymore of your time, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre very busy.‚Äù Packing up her bag, she thanked me and left, the broad smile still plastered on her face. It was disarming, and I couldn‚Äôt help but smile back at her as she walked out, saying goodbye. I vowed to do some research on my own before giving out the sample packages to anyone, so that night I took a box home with a brochure and decided I would do a few hours of reading, trying to find out what exactly the benefits and side effects of Smilatrex would be. Don‚Äôt ask what got into my head. Why I ended up taking the pills, especially when I didn‚Äôt even know the first thing about the company or the product. I wouldn't say I'm depressed, per say. But I've slipped into a bit of a rut since my father died a couple years back. Every day feels the same.

"I made my players lose their shit for about 15 minutes long Edit: Thank you kind stranger for internet silver :) Edit 2: Wow, did not expect gold, cheers! &amp;#x200B; I'm pretty new to DM'ing, running a first campaign for 5 people (Fighter, Mage, Druid, Warlock and Paladin). Homebrew and rule of cool apply. &amp;#x200B; Need to give some background info so: &amp;#x200B; Campaign mainly revolves around a set island where the south is infested with undead due to the returning of a necromancer who was killed 100 years ago. Group gets hired to take care of the problem. Session 0 and 1 are combined so it doesn't take long before the group is gathered at the shores of the mainland, ready to take off to said island. They aren't the only group that is being hired for the purpose of fending of the undead. Together with 3 other groups of 5 they are waiting for the galleon to arrive at the docks. Once the galleon does arrive in the distance there is a figure standing at the bow of it, a large figure. Once the galleon comes closer they can identify the figure as a large elf (7'2), the galleon slows down and comes to a stop at the docks where the male elf flicks his long golden hair, splattering his salt induces locks around, back flipping off of the bow to perform a gracious - Olympics landing. \---- 'I'm L'Ov√©ale, and i am.. worth it.' (Pronounced as - Loo, vee, jaal -) \------ Obviously the the hair flicking and the brand L'Or√©al comes to mind to the players who scoff it off. They share drinks with the elf and realize he's a horrible drunk - summoning giant mugs of beer for everyone. But they do become very good friends in a short amount of time. The group then goes through a few different stages of the campaign. &amp;#x200B; \- The galleon gets attacked by a Kraken, L'Ov√©ale jumps off the boat to face the kraken while commanding the groups to flee - the island is in sight so it should be swimmable. The group does get off the boat and attempts to swim to shore, they roll : 4, 6, 5, 8 and 3. They do make it, allthough deep in undead territory, without a glimpse of the other groups. \- Backtracking through enemy territory they manage to reach the border (Big river dividing the north and south, there's only 1 bridge). Big fight breaks out between undead and living at the border bridge. Bridge eventually gets blown up. \- They arrive at the city they were supposed to arrive with the galleon - is a slavers city. Long story short - part of the city gets blown up and is evacuated. &amp;#x200B; Now at this point we are at least 10 sessions in and L'Ov√©ale is something that keeps coming up. Every week. They haven't seen him, heard from him, but they check every inn or bar to check if he might be there. The last they know is him fighting off the Kraken and the nearby fisher's town serving a whole lot of giant sushi. As it is my first time DM'ing i'm quite proud - L'Ov√©ale is my very first NPC. &amp;#x200B; One week one of the campaign members isn't able to play, so i decided to host a one-shot canon story, inviting another friend to fill up the gap to 5 people. The players get pre-made characters by me. Dividing the character sheets went with a simple rule. I will call out the name of the character and his/her class, then someone can say 'Aye' if they want it. If no-one wants it, i roll for it to be randomly chosen. Calling out the first 2 names, unrecognizable names for the group but they still get chosen. The second 2 names are recognizable NPC's from the main campaign. Takes some time, but eventually they do get chosen. The last player wanted to wait out as long as he could - definitely digging for gold here. He receives the character sheet - named L'Ov√©ale - An elf male fighter. Players are totally stoked i put him in the one shot as we soon begin. Running a version of 'Igor's challenge' it does not take very long before some of the group is disqualified. Eventually the player who's playing as L'Ov√©ale happens upon the perfect challenge.

"Indefinite 32L One Bag Travel - 27+ countries over the next 13ish months with a single backpack Cross posting from r/onebag. Beginning in September I‚Äôve decided to live indefinitely out of a 32L backpack while traveling the globe. I‚Äôm a decently experienced traveler, have lived abroad, and got to do the digital nomad thing for a time - all this to say that I‚Äôm fairly confident going into this trip. My last lengthy one bag stint featured the Matador SEG30 (discontinued, but I still have mine and love it dearly) was in 2022; I visited 11 countries in around 6 months, working all the while. I actually cataloged some of my adventures on this account, including my original packing list! Fun memories to dig up and very interesting to compare my packing list now. This time around I‚Äôll be doing some more adventurous travel and leaving behind my DN-friendly work setup. I‚Äôve upgraded a lot of my gear, but there are still some proven winners from my last long trip; I tagged them in the packing list. THE PLAN: Complete 7-ish phases of travel across 27+ countries and end up in Australia/NZ around September/October 2026 * Baltics (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland) * Balkans (Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, Montenegro, Albania, North Macedonia, Serbia) * Southern Africa (South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe) * East Africa (Tanzania, Kenya, and possibly Uganda and/or Rwanda) * South Asia (India, Sri Lanka, Nepal) * SEA (Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Indonesia) * Oceania (Australia, New Zealand) BAG: A brand new Osprey Nebula 32L in Cascade Blue/Coal Grey - this will be its inauguration so I‚Äôm really hoping that I‚Äôve selected well! I‚Äôve switched to a more structured backpack mostly due to a lot more rugged conditions planned for this go-round and a higher likelihood of lengthy travel legs where the comfort of carrying a \~15kg load becomes more important. I‚Äôve also switched to an REI packable 16L backpack rather than a one-shoulder tote for the same reason. CLOTHES * Long sleeved: REI sun hoodie (2022 OG!), Icebreaker 200 merino ¬æ zip pullover * Short sleeved: Icebreaker short sleeve t-shirt, cotton blend t-shirt (2022 OG!), cotton blend tank top, Patagonia Capilene cool lightweight t-shirt * Pants: trekking/rock climbing pants, Nike leggings, Athleta joggers, Nike running shorts, loose pleated skirt * Budgie Smugglers swimsuit OUTERWEAR * Patagonia GoreTex shell jacket * Montbell packable down vest INNERWEAR * Darn Tough socks x 3 * Underwear x 5 * Bras x 3 SHOES: Nike sneakers, knock off Birkenstocks TECH * iPad Air 11‚Äù (2024 version) - not pictured * ThinkPad Bluetooth keyboard * iPhone 13 mini (last model to still have a physical SIM card slot, which is apparently a good feature in Africa) * 100W GaN charger w/global adaptors * Cables: USB-A &amp; C to lightning, USB-C to USB-C, Garmin watch charger, Quip toothbrush charger * AirTag x2 - one is attached to any keys I need along the way and one stays in my passport pouch TOILETRIES (I will buy consumables‚Äîshampoo, body wash, sunscreen, lotion, toothpaste, etc.‚Äîas needed. I fully recognize that I am a lucky lady and that I don‚Äôt need too many specialized products!) * Matador FlatPak toiletry case * Muji medicine holder (Ibuprofen, melatonin, sleeping pills, Pepto Bismol pills, Dramamine, Imodium) * Muji refillable 100 mL containers x2 * Cuticle clippers aka mini scissors * Tweezerman tweezers * Tweezerman nail clippers * Bobby pins &amp; hair ties * Quip rechargeable toothbrush * Jordan flosser stick * Tongue scraper - not pictured * Remington bikini line hair trimmer * Mach 3 razor * Braun bug bite zapper - not pictured, but I swear by this thing! It heats up a tiny ceramic plate very hot to disrupt the itching of bug bites, works great for me and a crowd favorite during a Peruvian Amazon retreat last year! * Laundry soap leaves - not pictured QUICK ACCESS TRANSIT POUCH (My extremely bright Elizabeth Scarlett flamingo pouch makes it a bit easier to spot in seatback ",Explorer,The North Face,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/HerOneBag/comments/1lnmtd4/indefinite_32l_one_bag_travel_27_countries_over/
"What is the strangest way you found out a friend was Wealthy? Here is my story which may sound like a movie. (I asked this question a couple of days back in r/delhi, and it was interesting to see the experiences of many people, so I thought to ask it on this sub too. I'm copy-pasting my experience.) So, this happened last year in mid-2024. We were all 21-22 year olds Engineering Students doing our summer internship at a renowned tech company in Noida. There was a 21 year old girl with us in the same company, who was pursuing [B.Tech](http://B.Tech) in Computer Science from one of the top colleges in Delhi (One of it from IIITD, DTU and NSUT). She was brilliant-with exceptional Coding skills and Tech knowledge, and was very hardworking. We were 5‚Äì6 students there from different colleges but we all quickly bonded well and became friends. That girl was pretty friendly, had a great sense of humour, smart and was very humble with everybody, and was gorgeous. She looked to hail from a well to do but grounded family. If I go in little detail: 1. She used to dress very well but not flashy and had 3-4 pairs of shoes that she repeated alternatively. All were from brands like Puma and Adidas. 2. She used an iPhone 13 Pro Max-an almost 3 year old model then as it was launched in 2021, and had Airpods as well as a Macbook. 3. She had amazing communication skills and spoke fluent English with a mix of modern slang and impressed us all with her knowledge‚Äînot just in tech, but also in geo-politics, economics, and even Sanskrit. She often quoted the Bhagavad Gita and would explain deep philosophical meanings from it, and all of were very impressed as well as initially surprised. As I'm into spirituality too, we both used to have a good time discussing many aspects of this and I learnt a lot from her. 4. She was very respectful towards everyone and used to speak to the Senior Engineers or the peon/security guard with the same politeness. 5. She used to reside in Noida itself and come to the Office via Metro and E-rickshaw. First, she to used to board from a Metro station nearest to her home in Noida, come to the nearest metro station of Office and then take an E-rickshaw to reach the Office which was about 2-3 kilometres away from the Metro station. In all, she seemed to come from an upper middle class family as per Delhi NCR standards-comfortable, but not ultra-rich. As many youngsters today own an iPhone (For example-I don't come from a rich family (maybe upper middle class) and myself owned an iPhone) and Airpods and branded Shoes, it was kind off ordinary and not something out of the World. Days and weeks passed. After the working hours, we all (5‚Äì6 people) used to eat the street food like Golgappe (that she loved the most) and Momo together after the office hours and were having a good time. She didn‚Äôt seem to be different from us at all in terms of financial background. Until one day. It was the time of mid-August, and there was a sudden and heavy rain at the evening right after the working hours. We were all standing near the gate inside the Office premises chit-chatting and looking at the rain and waiting for it to stop, but it didn‚Äôt give any such signs. 15-20 minutes passed but still, it was raining heavily. 2 people booked cabs and left. We were 4 people left now, when I asked her plans about leaving. She said she would wait for another 10 minutes and if she still couldn‚Äôt find any E-rickshaw, then she will ‚Äúsee‚Äù. As it was raining heavily, there were no E-rickshaws nearby too. (She used to take an E-rickshaw to the Metro station daily.) Neither the rain stopped nor she could find any E-rickshaw and 10 minutes passed. As I was observing her, she sent a text to somebody and right after a minute, got a call. She spoke something for 20 seconds or so and went near the gate and started walking back and forth there as she was waiting for someone. We all went there too and started chit-chatting among ourselves when, after around 10 minutes-",Explorer,The North Face,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndia/comments/1knwgn7/what_is_the_strangest_way_you_found_out_a_friend/
"Henry the balding idiot prince and his used pleasure appliance hoisted with their own petard Place a frog in a pot of cold water and put it on the stove. Turn on the gas. The creature cooks without ever realizing its desperate situation. Nature played a cruel trick on the frog leaving it vulnerable to external forces. Only the stupidest creatures expose themselves to threats of their own making. Henry the balding idiot prince and his used pleasure appliance are such stupid creatures. The response to the court case Friday by the Montecito morons was nothing less than the last test of their suitability for life in polite society and they failed miserably. And the verdict was issued by the palace itself. The judgement released by the court today was issued at Easter giving the morons of Montecito weeks to prepare a response. The interview Harry gave and the statements they issued were not knee jerk responses. They revealed two people so full of their own bullshit they could not see beyond it. They could not imagine that the palace would have any public response to their bullshit. The frog prince and his concubine thought they could rely on the grayrocking to continue no matter what they did. They even tested the waters by throwing an hrh picture up on meghans self love fest to make sure their continued silence could be relied upon. Like the reptile that is his spirit animal, the frog prince is unaware of who he is and where he is in the world he has created. Allow me to rant with a bit of history before tying the final knot around these narcissists. Their lives today are a complete mess. Just listing their biggest catastrophes is challenging. She has failed as an author, a humanitarian, a fire warden and a philanthropist. Her oprah interview was an embarrassment of lies, reinforced by a Netflix series that tried to build on her deceptions. Netflix, lemonada, Disney and the introduction of her lifestyle brands have been spectacular failures. She was branded a grifter by Spotify execs. This useless twit has been publicly exposed as a bully in europe amd north america, with rumors of her bullying extending to 3 other continents. Her poison has spilled onto his reputation with invictus. From leading wounded soldiers while cosplaying a street walker in germany to intruding on Harry's limelight in Canada, she has markled his involvement in his pet project. He wrote a book that proved his willingness to compromise his integrity to maintain the facade of his relevance. In the oprah interview and their fictional fuck-you-mentary series these two grifters clung to each other's lies as they weaved their new house of deception. He walked away from his responsibilities with African Parks and walked away from a second charity when his entitlement was called out and his charitable intentions legally challenged. His involvement in Better Up has led to layoffs of individuals who questioned if the job description of ""chief impact officer"" included driving away business. His ability to purchase awards for himself and his wife has helped expose the hypocrisy of the celebrity machine. From claiming to be a private jet flying environmentalist, a bunker bound war hero, a legend of aviation with an unverified pilot's license and receiving the Pat Tillman award over the objection of Pat's mother, Henry was determined not to let his wife outshine him in questionable accomplishments. These and many more of their dubious achievements have led these idiots to the precipice of bankruptcy and irrelevance. And now we arrive at the court case, their response and the choices that lie ahead. The loss of his court case friday and a million pound legal bill was not enough to bring this idiot down to earth. He continued to plead his case to higher authorities who have zero interest in being Harry's savior. If they actually looked at their situation they would realize the water is boiling over.

"[MEGATHREAD] Already faced with a failing data center in 2019, North Central Missouri College chose CDW as their partner in a major infrastructure transformation project. See the solution we built and learn how that foundation allowed the school to shift to remote learning in 2020. ***TL;DR:*** *With a small team already pushed to the limit, North Central Missouri College (NCMC) turned to* [CDW for help overhauling their systems](https://www.cdw.com/content/cdw/en/articles/datacenter/digital-transformation-at-north-central-missouri-college.html)*. From a brand-new data center and video surveillance system to upgraded wired and wireless networks, there was a lot of work to be done. Once everything was up-and-running, they realized dramatic time savings ‚Äì extensive weekly patching was a thing of the past. And better yet, the infrastructure was already in place to support remote learning when classes went virtual.* https://preview.redd.it/dwvyomd7skm81.png?width=2872&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a373ca320bdeb9bdd4851501b56f2fb0e9ca4b0 When Jennifer Triplett stepped into her new job as CIO at North Central Missouri College, she knew what she was getting into. NCMC had brought her on in the summer of 2019 to lead an IT department of nine people. A two-year community college founded in 1925, the school‚Äôs main campus is in the city of Trenton, Mo., but it also operates through several other sites and serves students across a total of 16 counties. As the institution looked ahead to its 100th anniversary, it hoped to find a way to modernize its IT systems. Her first major mission, Triplett recalls, was to get a feel for the ‚Äúcurrent state‚Äù so her team could develop a roadmap for implementation. https://preview.redd.it/un5hn896rkm81.jpg?width=472&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6d2d3cbc97650169eb64fa657d3376838aa163e ‚ÄúWhat we found was that most of our technology was either out of date or soon to be out of date,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúEven with some of the things we‚Äôd put in relatively recently, we were being hit with really high renewal costs, and it just wasn‚Äôt sustainable.‚Äù Triplett says students and instructors were also complaining about wireless network performance, while video security across the school‚Äôs sites was in dire need of a major upgrade. Then there was the matter of its aging data center, which appeared to be on its last legs. ‚ÄúWe had discs failing, hosts failing, everything was failing,‚Äù she explains. ‚ÄúThe overhead with managing that infrastructure had become significant. We were constantly having to troubleshoot failed hardware.‚Äù With the data center as her primary objective, Triplett reached out to CDW and met with account manager Brendan Murphy. That was followed by several site visits by a team of CDW solution architects and engineers. Soon, she says, it became perfectly clear what NCMC needed to do.

"[Feminist Instagram Community] Exposing Doyouconsideryourselfafeminist (DYCYAF) for Catfishing and Lost Donations Long time lurker on this forum and was reminded of this particular drama after reading about the recent hivliving x Hamilton fandom catfishing drama. ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1u6dcP\_JNc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1u6dcP_JNc)) &amp;#x200B; Doyouconsideryourselfafeminist (DYCYAF) started as an instagram account asking men on tinder that exact question and posting the (usually ridiculous) answers. She existed in the same instagram realm as whydidyouswiperighttho or datingjustsucks. She ended up getting to I think about 50k followers before the account was deleted. On the new accounts she made, she expressed a lot of fear and frustration over the deletion of her account for all the support she does for the feminist community and was very critical of people reporting posts because it threatened her entire platform and all of these ""opportunities"" she'd been offered supposedly from publications. Basically, this is where things started getting weird and moving away from tinder convos. &amp;#x200B; A little background on DYCYAF: the account was run by a girl named Sarah KP (some people had her on facebook and that was her facebook name) who claimed to be a North African/Moroccan activist/academic from Montreal. She claimed to have an auto-immune disease and should've already been dead, but definitely doesn't have more than 5 years left. As a result, she could never have kids and would probably never find love, but she was fine with that because she refused to lower her standards just because she was lonely. She had the perfect ex-boyfriend named Alistair who was some type of rich, British, academic of some political family (she might have claimed he was royalty I can't exactly remember) and they met at Harvard or University of Oxford and broke up because even though he was so good, she was still better than him and because he was white. She often posted text or facebook conversations between them with him praising her or some weird back and forth about privilege etc. Not surprisingly, he had the same text style as Sarah KP, which was written off because they were so close and knew each other for so long. One iconic story about Sarah came from Alistair after his friend messaged him ""Mate you mind if I ask your ex bird out? She's hardcore like me I fancy that."" Alistair proceeds to prove no one is as ""hardcore"" as Sarah and launches off into a story about how they were in Palestine during a bombing and Sarah saved a child hiding under a car, despite Alistair trying to pull her to safety, and ruined her knees in the process, all while wearing designer heels. Or how she humiliated a man in an ""impromptu comedy act"" at a charity ball for making a joke about the black singers, ultimately causing this man to double his donations. &amp;#x200B; These personal stories, usually shared through the scope of a ""friend"" praising Sarah, started to get sprinkled into her profile probably about a year and a half before the Great Callout. The original account pretty strictly only shared on-brand content, like the tinder convos and other feminist discourse. Towards the end of her profile, there were almost no tinder conversations being posted at all and turned into more of a cult. I kept following because it was easy enough to ignore her humble bragging and she still shared content that I enjoyed. The cult mentality started to get out of control when she started enlisting her followers to harass people that either disagreed with her, reported her, or ""stole"" from her. &amp;#x200B; One instance I remember being really turned off by was when she sent her followers to attack the author of a New York Times author that wrote about Disney princes as feminists or something. Sarah shared the NYT article on her page, it might have just been screenshots of it.

"Indefinite 32L One Bag Travel - 27+ countries over the next 13ish months with a single backpack Beginning in September I‚Äôve decided to live indefinitely out of a 32L backpack while traveling the globe. I‚Äôm a decently experienced traveler, have lived abroad, and got to do the digital nomad thing for a time - all this to say that I‚Äôm fairly confident going into this trip. My last lengthy one bag stint featured the Matador SEG30 (discontinued, but I still have mine and love it dearly) was in 2022; I visited 11 countries in around 6 months, working all the while. I actually cataloged some of my adventures on this account, including my original packing list! Fun memories to dig up and very interesting to compare my packing list now. This time around I‚Äôll be doing some more adventurous travel and leaving behind my DN-friendly work setup. I‚Äôve upgraded a lot of my gear, but there are still some proven winners from my last long trip; I tagged them in the packing list. THE PLAN: Complete 7-ish phases of travel across 27+ countries and end up in Australia/NZ around September/October 2026 * Baltics (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland) * Balkans (Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, Montenegro, Albania, North Macedonia, Serbia) * Southern Africa (South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe) * East Africa (Tanzania, Kenya, and possibly Uganda and/or Rwanda) * South Asia (India, Sri Lanka, Nepal) * SEA (Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Indonesia) * Oceania (Australia, New Zealand) BAG: A brand new Osprey Nebula 32L in Cascade Blue/Coal Grey - this will be its inauguration so I‚Äôm really hoping that I‚Äôve selected well! I‚Äôve switched to a more structured backpack mostly due to a lot more rugged conditions planned for this go-round and a higher likelihood of lengthy travel legs where the comfort of carrying a \~15kg load becomes more important.

"Unidentified: Participants in 1957 Gay Wedding Ceremony (Possible Location: Philadelphia, USA) (This unresolved mystery was posted fairly recently, but time may be of the essence to identify these men. As one of the archivists working on the subject said, **""What would be a huge help is just getting these photos in front of a bunch of 80 and 90-year-olds.""**) In the mid to late 1950s, two men in their 20s or 30s married each other in what appears to be a small ceremony in an apartment. Somebody at the wedding took candid shots of the grooms exchanging rings before an officiant, sharing their first kiss as newlyweds, opening gifts and cutting their wedding cake, as well as of guests enjoying themselves and dancing. A person or persons (see below) dropped off the film with the wedding photos at a neighborhood drugstore in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1957. After developing the photos, however, the drugstore's manager deemed them ""inappropriate"" and refused to return them to the customer(s). One of his employees kept the photos, intending to return them if she ever saw that customer again, but they never came back. The 21 prints ended up with the personal photos of the drugstore employee. Her daughter found them in the early 2010s, and today they are the shared property of the ONE National Gay and Lesbian Archives at USC and the John J. Wilcox Jr. Archives at the William Way LGBT Center. **Archivists at both are seeking to identify the grooms and return to them this piece of their lives that was stolen.** The prints can be viewed here: [https://www.ouronestory.com/1957-gay-wedding](https://www.ouronestory.com/1957-gay-wedding) WHAT WE KNOW: * The roll of film was dropped off at a drugstore/photo shop at **Broad Street and Allegheny Avenue** in **North Philadelphia** in **1957**. It seems PLAUSIBLE that the wedding also took place in Philadelphia, but this is not certain. 1957 is also a very plausible year for the photos, based on the clothing, hairstyles, and interior decorating visible. * The majority of the participants (grooms, officiant, guests) are **white men between the ages of about 20-60**. (At least one white woman is partially visible in the background of a few shots.) Their birth years are circa 1897-1937. A person who was 25 in 1957 has a birth year of 1932 and would be **87 years old in 2019.** That's about all which is certain. Other factors that may be important in identifying the participants include: * **The families of the two grooms may never have known** that their sons/brothers/uncles were in a committed relationship. Same-sex marriage and sexual relations were illegal in the US, and would be for decades to come. If the couple lived together, which seems likely, they may have been ""roommates"" or may not have even been known to each other's families. * The wedding and reception were a small, intimate affair. Before the 1960s, local gay communities placed **discretion and secrecy** in high regard, knowing they could pay the price if they didn't. The LGBT archivists and researchers interviewed on the photo mystery are unanimous that photos like these are rare for that very reason. * The comments of the July post to this sub (linked below) speculated a lot about **why the person(s) who dropped off the film would have done so at a drugstore photo shop**, if they knew the photos could potentially ""out"" people or be confiscated. Some of the articles state or imply that one or both of the grooms took the film to the drugstore, but that is not certain at all; the nameless drugstore employee who took the prints home had passed away before her daughter found them, and the back story we have is what the employee had told her husband about them. The upcoming docu-series about the photos may reveal more information. Anyway, to return to the point, we don't know if the person who dropped off the film knew what was on it. Maybe it was an unprocessed roll they took for their brother or friend. Or maybe they just didn't thi",Explorer,The North Face,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/e81u1m/unidentified_participants_in_1957_gay_wedding/
"The Beginner's Guide to Modern NXT NXT has undergone a pretty sweeping shift recently, with the top stars of the brand (and even some midcard stars) having made the jump to the main roster. NXT has now switched to a more character-building mode, which means now is a great time to jump into the developmental brand and learn from fresh. *** **NXT'S STYLE** *** First up, NXT 2.0 has been dead for a WHILE now, but in the last calendar year NXT has strongly stripped away the odd booking that permeated the colour era. White and Gold NXT is very firmly a developmental brand, so it‚Äôs worth going into it knowing that the stars on the show are not finished products. Fans of the show are much more forgiving to its stars and adopt a much stronger ‚Äúwait and see‚Äù attitude to that of fans of the main roster. The intimate setting of NXT also hugely helps with crowd interaction, and fans will have some unique crowd chants for stars very early on. The entire atmosphere has a very ‚Äúcollege‚Äù feel, tends to be more lighthearted and seems much more specifically catered towards young adults. With Ilja Dragunov and Carmelo Hayes at the helm, NXT White and Gold had the best year in NXT‚Äôs history, and with those two stars moving up, NXT has changed drastically. *** **NXT'S TV AND PLE FORMATS** *** NXT actually has 2 shows; NXT and NXT Lvl Up. Both shows are filmed in the Performance Centre every week, fostering a specific fanbase for the brand in the same way that a territory like ECW did. Lvl Up, formerly 205 Live, is basically developmental for the developmental, with lowercard and midcard talents that may not otherwise get large amounts of ring time being afforded a spotlight. Lvl Up stories do not usually translate over to NXT proper. NXT‚Äôs specials format is split between 2 week TV events and PLEs, alternating between the two every month. Almost all these events use old PLE names that were used in WWE, WCW or ECW but have been since discontinued by WWE‚Äôs main roster, such as Battleground, The Great American Bash, Heatwave, Vengeance Day, etc. Stand and Deliver is NXT‚Äôs Wrestlemania, and takes place on Mania Saturday Morning. Last year‚Äôs event list was: - *Spring Breakin‚Äô (Special)* - **Battleground (PLE)** - *Gold Rush (Special)* - **The Great American Bash (PLE)** - *Heatwave (Special)* - **No Mercy (PLE)** - *Halloween Havoc (Special)* - **Deadline (PLE)** - *New Year‚Äôs Evil (Special)* - **Vengeance Day (PLE)** - *Roadblock (Special)* - **Stand And Deliver (PLE)** *** **NXT'S ACCOLADES** *** NXT, just like the main roster, has its own special prizes to be won. The biggest of these are the Breakout Tournaments, the Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic, and the Iron Survivor Match. - The Breakout Tournaments are 2 tournaments, one male and one female, held between 8 rookies each, all of whom have only been on NXT TV for less than a year. The winners of these tournaments receive a contract that is basically NXT‚Äôs Money in the Bank; they can get a title shot for a championship of their choosing at any time. The main difference is that Tag Championships are also on the table, and midcard belts are frequently selected for cash-ins. - The Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic is a tag team tournament, and the rules change ALL the time, but presently, 8 male teams go into this single elimination tournament, and if the winners are not already the NXT Tag Team Champions, they receive a shot at the championships at Vengeance Day (January). - The Iron Survivor match happens at the Deadline PLE (December) every year and is an absolutely electric match type. 5 superstars compete, and 2 start in the ring, with a new one entering every 5 minutes until all are in the ring. The time limit is 25 minutes and whoever scores the most falls will win the match. There‚Äôs an added twist however; if you give up a fall, be it through pinfall or submission, you are sent into a penalty box and are unable to pick up any falls for 90 seconds. The winner receives a championship match at the TV",Explorer,The North Face,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/1d0x9g5/the_beginners_guide_to_modern_nxt/

Have a question that we didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t address? Call our support team at 1-800-726-7377 or contact us online. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS Are Pampers diapers and ingredients safe? Yes! All Pampers products are safe. Our diapers, wipes, and training pants use carefully evaluated ingredients that are common in most diapers and wipes and are safely used by millions of babies every day. What are the 4 Steps in the Pampers Safety Promise? The Pampers Safety Promise ensures that every element of our products are safe for baby. Step 1: Ensure Safety at the Source Step 2: Assess Manufactured Components Step 3: Evaluate Every Product Step 4: Monitor Again (and Again) How does Pampers ensure products are safe for my baby? Our safety team works with medical professionals and safety experts to evaluate every ingredient for potential risks. We also invest in clinical safety studies and monitor products through safety checks, both on the production line and at home. How do you choose Pampers‚Äö√Ñ√¥ ingredients? Our ingredients are carefully chosen based on safety profiles and their demonstrated effectiveness for keeping baby‚Äö√Ñ√¥s skin dry and healthy. We evaluate every ingredient to ensure it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s safe before it ever comes in contact with your baby‚Äö√Ñ√¥s skin. Do diapers cause diaper rash? While diaper rash is one of the most common pediatric conditions, it is not caused by diapers. Diaper rash is caused by a combination of factors like excessive skin hydration, increase in pH, and irritants in bowel movements and friction. What is skin pH? pH is the level of which something is acidic or basic, on a scale of 1-14. Healthy infant skin ranges from 4.7-6, but urine and stool can increase the pH, making the skin more susceptible to rashes. What is a taped diaper? Taped diapers use strips (or ‚Äö√Ñ√∫tape‚Äö√Ñ√π) to secure the diaper to your baby‚Äö√Ñ√¥s waist. This allows for a custom and adjustable fit for your baby and can be especially useful for newborns whose umbilical cords have not fallen off. What are Pampers¬¨√Ü Diaper Pants? Diaper pants are soft and stretchy. We‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve designed these diapers for infants 6+ months old, especially those who are beginning to crawl and flip over. These diapers can be pulled on while your baby is standing up and have tear-away sides for easy removal. What‚Äö√Ñ√¥s in Pampers diapers? Pampers diapers are composed of a topsheet, stretchy fastenings, a dual acquisition layer and absorbent core, flexible leg cuffs and elastics, fun drawings, adhesives, and a waterproof backsheet. Some diapers also include a mild ointment and a wetness indicator. Will diaper adhesives come into contact with my baby‚Äö√Ñ√¥s skin? No. Adhesives are used throughout the diaper to keep the parts of the diaper together and avoid leakage. These adhesives are solvent-free and do not come into direct contact with your baby‚Äö√Ñ√¥s skin. How do diapers absorb all the moisture? Pampers diapers contain absorbent gelling material that can absorb nearly 30 times its weight. In rare cases, you may notice small gel particles on your baby‚Äö√Ñ√¥s skin‚Äö√Ñ√Æthis is the absorbent material and can easily be removed by wiping gently. What are gel beads? Are they safe if they touch my baby‚Äö√Ñ√¥s skin? These beads are part of our absorbent gelling material, which has a long history of safe use in diapers. If you notice small gel particles on your baby‚Äö√Ñ√¥s skin, it is the absorbent material and can be easily removed by gentle wiping. Is the gel safe in my baby's diaper? Like all materials and ingredients in our diapers, super-absorbent gel is safe as used in our diapers. Pampers conducts tests to evaluate the safety of this ingredient ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ adding to the large body of evidence that shows the safety of this gel for babies' skin. Are Pampers diapers scented?

"More than 5000 changing tables installed! Picture this‚Ä¶ dad is out and about, enjoying quality time with his baby and the inevitable hits: diaper duty. Cue the search for a changing table, only for dad to learn there‚Äôs nowhere for him to change that stinky booty in the men‚Äôs restroom. It‚Äôs an all-too-familiar story that happens across the country, with Pampers research revealing that 9 out of 10 dads have gone into a public restroom that has not had a baby changing table*. Pampers recognizes dads are more hands-on than ever and wanted to help enable them to take the best possible care of their babies. In 2021, Pampers partnered with Koala Kare to install more than 5,000 changing tables across North America‚Äîin all 50 states and 7 Canadian provinces to more than 870 organizations! 1 According to a 2019 survey of 200 U.S. parents by Consumer & Market Knowledge for Pampers Changing table inequality was placed front and center in 2018, fueled by an image posted on social media of Florida father, Donte Palmer, with his child in his lap squatting to change his son's diaper. Since that post, which garnered national and international media attention, Palmer has founded #SquatForChange, an organization committed to arming dads with the proper changing table resources they need to be hands-on with their children. Palmer is working with Pampers to champion thousands of dads who have used social media to voice their desire to see changing table equality. Musician, activist and Pampers spokesperson, John Legend, will also help the brand introduce this commitment to hands-on dads. ‚ÄúI love being a hands-on dad, but it's definitely frustrating when I am out with Miles and the men's restroom doesn't have a baby changing table,‚Äù said John Legend. ‚ÄúAnd I know that it's not just happening to me, all dads face this inequality. It's staggering to me that in 2019 if dads want to change our baby's diaper in public we have to get creative ‚Äì should we trudge back to our cars, squat and physically become the changing table like Donte Palmer, or limit our outings to the places we know there are changing stations? That's why I couldn't be more excited that Pampers is making this commitment ‚Äì it's an acknowledgement of fatherhood and the important role dads play in their babies' lives.‚Äù 1 According to a recent survey of 200 U.S. parents by Consumer & Market Knowledge for Pampers 2 Based on retail sales",Caregiver,Pampers,google_cse,https://www.pampers.com/en-us/about-us/community-impact/article/changing-tables

"Forza 5 Review Roundup (it's good) [Eurogamer: 7/10](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-11-20-forza-motorsport-5-review) *Ignore the nonsense, though, and it can still be electrifying. Take an Audi R18 e-tron away from the messy drone of the career and set about beating a Rivals hot lap time around Spa and it's sublime: the diesel engine roars stealthily, the sun streaming through the Ardennes' thick forest. With Forza Motorsport 5, Turn 10's created a driving experience both accessible and beautiful - but it's been stripped back to make Xbox One's launch, and augmented with a host of ugly extras that only serve Microsoft's bid to make a few dollars more.* [IGN: 8.8/10](http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/20/forza-motorsport-5-review) *Forza 5 is gorgeous and smooth as butter, and its utterly enchanting handling makes it a joy to drive hard, but this game is more than just a rock solid technical titan for the Xbox One. It‚Äôs an essential destination for the automobile obsessed. It may be lighter on girth than where we left off last generation, and still lacking much-requested features like night racing and rain, but wrestling a car through some of the world‚Äôs most legendary corners at the very limits of adhesion has never looked or felt this good on console.* [Polygon: 9/10](http://www.polygon.com/2013/11/20/5124990/forza-5-review) *Forza 5 is beautiful, sure, with a stunning, light-filled world of engines and tire smoke. But with the introduction of aggressive, convincing AI that makes every offline race feel like a multiplayer competition, Turn 10 has charted a course for the future of the series ‚Äî and created the Xbox One's first must-own game.* [Gamespot: 9/10](http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/forza-motorsport-5-review/1900-6415570/) *All of this combined makes Forza Motorsport 5 an outstanding improvement to an already excellent racing franchise. It's far more than just a great racing sim, or a gorgeous showcase for the types of feats the Xbox One hardware is capable of. This is a game built on the romantic thrill of motorsport in all its forms, and that love for its subject matter is all but impossible to resist.* [Destructoid: 9/10](http://www.destructoid.com/review-forza-motorsport-5-265990.phtml) *This all helps make up for what feels like a thinner game than its predecessor. Even with all of its visual wow and cloud features, Forza 5 feels like there should have been more to it. In some ways it feels like an incremental content update with brand new visuals. Maybe more tracks would have helped. Or maybe some kind of underlying progression in the career mode would have made a difference. But, at the end of the day, the racing is what matters. And with this game, the racing is fantastic, and Turn 10 is really onto something with this Drivatar stuff. It alone gives Forza Motorsport 5 something over every other racer out there, pushing the genre forward. They've remedied the racing genre's biggest problem: scripted AI cars.* [CVG: 7/10](http://www.computerandvideogames.com/439311/reviews/review-forza-motorsport-5-is-a-beautiful-simulation-but-subdued-racer-review/) *But Forza 5 is not a racing game. Not really. It's a driving simulation that features races. Despite all the quality of the production, these chases aren't as thrilling as those of Forza 4, let alone GRID or F1 2013. So unless you're convinced the remarkable graphics and attention to automotive detail are absolutely worth your money, there are other racing games that play much better.* [Escapist: 3.5/5](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/editorials/reviews/10766-Forza-Motorsport-5-Review) *It's quite possibly the best looking next-gen title. Hardcore fans will enjoy it to its full extent, but it's fairly forgiving to newcomers as well. There's just not a ton of middle ground, you'll either really love it or not be interested at all.* [GameInformer: 8.75/10](http://www.gameinformer.com/games/forza_motorsport_5/b/xboxone/archive/2013/11/20/forza-5-",Rebel,Diesel,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1r257u/forza_5_review_roundup_its_good/

"The Troller T4. A Brazilian off-roader that was very well regarded due to it's power and reliability, but that unfortunately was closed down by Ford despite the offers other brands did to buy it back a keep it running. Brazilian company founded under the name Troler (with only one ‚ÄòL‚Äô) by engineer Rog√©rio Farias in Horizonte (CE) in 1995 to manufacture a jeep of his own creation. Rog√©rio, who had recently produced the Fyber buggy, designed a proper 4√ó4 utility vehicle, of which around 50 units were built in the pre-industrial phase. Characterized by a fiberglass-reinforced plastic body with a four-point roll bar and a style strongly inspired by the traditional North American Jeep Wrangler, the vehicle had a chassis integrated into the body, a 99 hp Volkswagen AP 1.8 gasoline engine, a five-speed gearbox with electric drive for all-wheel drive and reduced-range drive, disc brakes on all four wheels and power steering. The suspension was semi-independent: at the front, coil springs and a rigid axle with central pivot; at the rear, also coil springs, but with oscillating arms under the rigid axle. Axles (Dana), transfer case and gearbox (Borg Warner) were imported, totaling about 35% of the vehicle's value. Here are some of its off-road performance parameters: ¬∑Free clearance: 21.5 cm (8.46 in); ¬∑Entry angle: 56¬∞; ¬∑Departure angle: 36¬∞; ¬∑Maximum ramp: 47¬∞; ¬∑Maximum side slope: 45¬∞; ¬∑Without snorkel: 80 cm (31.5 in). Such a well-designed project needed solid foundations to be put into practice, and Rog√©rio took advantage of 1997 to consolidate his plans: he partnered with businessman M√°rio Araripe (who took over as president), registered the jeep industrialization project in the expanded Automotive Regime for the North, Northeast and Central-West regions (of the 25 approved, it was the only one that came to fruition) and changed the car's name, adding another 'L' to the brand. **SUDDENLY, A LARGE BRAZILIAN OFF-ROADER** In 1998, now called the Troller, a revised version was launched (now with a 114 hp AP 2.0 engine) and was significantly improved, especially in the bodywork, which received a recess in the running board, under the doors, turn signal lights on the side of the front fenders, additional air intakes on the hood, a new steering wheel and a redesigned instrument panel, using only Volkswagen components. The body was now mounted on cushions, independent of the chassis, and the brakes were changed to ventilated discs in the front and drums in the rear. The car, which came with leather seats and air conditioning, continued to have only one option for a canvas top with plastic windows. The following year, this updated version was named T4. Production was already reaching 70 units per month. (According to the commitments made to the Ministry of Industry, after being expanded and re-equipped, the Horizonte factory would reach a capacity of 2,200 vehicles per year.) From the beginning, Troller invested heavily in participating in competitions. In a bold decision, it entered four jeeps in the Paris-Dakar-Cairo rally, which would take place in January 2000: this would be the first time that a national car would compete in the world's most important endurance race. The four were the T5 model, still under development, more sophisticated and 12 cm (4.72 in) larger than the T4. In addition to the reinforcements required by the FIA, the competition cars received a more powerful engine (an imported Ford V6 4.0, with 162 hp), two shock absorbers per wheel, a larger fuel tank and a system for changing tire pressure while the car was moving. Troller's results in its first participation in such a difficult race were remarkable: 4th, 6th and 11th places in the ‚ÄúNovices‚Äù category (46th, 53rd and 75th places in the overall standings, respectively) and three of the four cars finishing the race (1/3 of the 144 competing vehicles abandoned the race). The navigator Amyr Klink was one of the members of the Troller team.

"Mapping Out SVT‚Äôs (Ever-Growing) Brand Universe What has always fascinated me ever since I got into SVT last year is the incredible breadth and depth of the SVT brand (admittedly an occupational hazard for a Carat who works in branding and communications heh). There is never a dull day ‚Äî a comeback is followed by a whole barrage of content, followed by a sub-unit comeback, followed by a world tour, followed by another launch, another campaign, another stream of content‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs so much to experience and to love, and it‚Äôs no wonder that SVT has steadily enjoyed a strong brand reputation over the years. Now, with the much-anticipated HxW debut coming up, Puzzle Seventeen just being previewed, the members‚Äô fashion week brand appearances, and a Suntory brand endorsement teaser dropping, I thought it timely to analyse the sprawling universe of SVT‚Äôs brand, and why it has such powerful appeal to ever-larger audiences around the world. As anyone who‚Äôs ever been exposed to marketing as a discipline would know, most successful brands ride on sheer repetition. Keep reinforcing, reiterating a clear, distinct message and a unified brand language through consistency and a ‚Äòsticky‚Äô image would start forming in your target audience‚Äôs mind. That becomes trickier as a brand continues to evolve and scale up ‚Äî be it to capture new segments, take up a more mature, elevated positioning, or grow more rapidly across markets. This is where ‚Äòbrand architecture‚Äô comes in ‚Äî a systematic way of organising a brand and its various associated attributes through the appropriate hierarchy of visuals, naming, etc. In general, there are two conventional models of brand architecture. The first is a ‚Äòbranded house‚Äô, which concentrates the brand equity in a singular, strong master brand; one of the best examples is Apple, which slaps the iconic bitten fruit logo on phones, tablets, laptops, computers, (cars?), and more. In the world of K-pop, one example would be EXO, which labels its sub-units EXO-K, EXO-M, and so on, with EXO anchoring the image. The second model is ‚Äòhouse of brands‚Äô, where a master brand runs a portfolio of brands and lets those subsidiary brands develop and cultivate their own identity and equity. The classic example can be found in the world of consumer goods, where brands as diverse as Magnum, Ben &amp; Jerry‚Äôs, Lifebuoy, Dove, Knorr all live under Unilever‚Äôs roof. This allows the individual brands to fully express themselves in their respective categories, while still benefiting from the halo credibility of the master brand. Now, when it comes to SVT, the brand architecture seems to combine elements of both models in a finely calibrated balance. The master brand identity has gone through several iterations since the group‚Äôs debut in 2015, with its latest form unveiled in March 2022. As you‚Äôd see in this super sleek case study (https://form-function.kr/project/seventeen) by form &amp; function ‚Äî an award-winning, Seoul-based design firm that worked with Pledis to design SVT‚Äôs brand, a lot of work had gone into crafting this bold, confident expression of the group‚Äôs identity. The concept of ‚ÄòUnstoppable Youth‚Äô as expressed by the never-ending Penfold triangle is a distinctive anchor of the brand. The name SEVENTEEN evokes the number associated with the vibrancy of youth, and the theme runs through so many of SVT‚Äôs songs ‚Äì from Cheers to Youth to BSS‚Äôs CBZ (Youth is Now). Much like the unmistakable Newton‚Äôs apple, SVT‚Äôs name, logo, thematic identity all carry a unique imprint; the story behind the name ‚Äì often seen as a misnomer for an obvious reason ‚Äì becomes a memorable marker in its own right.

"[7 YoE, Unemployed, Digital Marketer &amp; SEO, US] I've been Unemployed from a layoffs from a Healthcare SaaS company for about 2 years. I was actually running the Marketing team and had 3 people under me. I've done odd jobs and worked retail since then. I work part-time at YMCA as a trainer but it doesn't apy much. I'd like to get back to my Digital Marketing career. I've focused on learning video and YouTube. The current job I have listed is a job board and recruiting firm that I tried to launch with friends. I am an expert at job board SEO and have 2 recruiter friends. They got offers to go to the major healthcare system, It's terrible time to be in the talent or jobs space but I keep it there as relevant pro experience on the resume. Really unsure what direction to take currently with my career or what to highlight. I've done Marketing. My focus has been on Digital Marketing with SEO. My specialty is Keyword Research and understanding search intent, which sounds easy but a lot of people are not skilled at. I've done lots of other things which includes Email Campaigns, CRM Integrations, and Tradeshow Marketing too. I've do experiments with OpenAI credits direct with Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) tools. Bulk generating AI articles to see what ranks in Google. Makes my own writing faster with my own BYOK tools and process. Running AI Audio and AI Image experiments too, but it gets expensive fast. I did Sales for packaging and processing machines. Selling capital equipment can be a challenge but it was interesting hearing about different products people had to package. I helped setup a theatre Google Ads account, specifically Google Ad Grants. It's a program where you get $10k in free ad money in Google Ads monthly. Helped me learn a lot about Paid Ads. I've tweaked my resume a lot and used tools like Rezi to tailor them to specific jobs. It hasn't gotten me anywhere. I got a Life &amp; Health Insurance licensed as part of a pre-hire process for a financial services firm. They ended up ghosting me, which is odd since they spend $400 on my training. I have Diesel Tech cert I never used. Applied to some Fire Depts, didn't get in. Thinking about going Police or to school for Nursing. I have good experience but nobody cares in this job market.

"What is Greenwashing in Marketing? Sustainability has become a key consideration for consumers in recent years, particularly among younger generations. In response to the global impact of climate change, many people want to use the power of their purchasing decisions to support companies that prioritize environmental protection through sustainable initiatives. A PwC survey found that some consumers are willing to spend 9.7% more for sustainably produced or sourced goods. This has led to companies engaging in sustainable marketing to promote environmentally and, in many cases, socially responsible products, practices, and brand values. The problem is that many companies are overstating or overclaiming their positive environmental impact: this is a practice known as ‚Äògreenwashing‚Äô. The aim is to attract consumers who seek out sustainability. However, these types of false claims can result in negative PR and damage a brand‚Äôs reputation. So how can marketers promote sustainable and environmental initiatives as part of their corporate social responsibility practices, but avoid accusations of greenwashing? In this blog, we‚Äôll explore: What is greenwashing? How is greenwashing harmful? 4 examples of greenwashing 8 ways marketers can avoid greenwashing What is greenwashing? According to RepRisk, an environmental, social, and corporate governance data science company, greenwashing is the practice of making unsubstantiated, untrue, or misleading claims about the environmental benefits of a company‚Äôs products and initiatives to attract customers and investors who prioritize sustainability. This could include misleading information about a product‚Äôs sustainability or labeling a service as ‚Äògreen‚Äô when it‚Äôs not. Greenwashing also occurs on a spectrum that can range from blatant deceit to wishful thinking. A famous example is ‚ÄòDieselgate‚Äô from German car maker Volkswagen, which marketed its diesel vehicles as low-emission and environmentally friendly. In reality, the cars were equipped with software that cheated emissions tests and released up to 40 times more nitrogen oxides than allowed in the US. A newer term used in the wake of greater awareness is ‚Äògreenhushing‚Äô. ‚ÄúGreenwashing is where brands are not talking about their environmental credentials because they‚Äôre afraid of more interrogation or of the policies that are coming down the line. ‚Äú \- Laura Costello, Head of Sustainability and Planet Services at ThinkHouse on the DMI podcast The danger with greenwashing is that it means companies don‚Äôt communicate about their environmental practices at all. This leads to a lack of awareness among consumers and hides any good practices that could have a positive impact on the environment and wider industry. How is greenwashing harmful? While greenwashing may help marketers attract consumers to a brand, misleading or incorrect claims could lead to serious consequences. For a company, greenwashing can result in: Damage to brand reputation: By participating in greenwashing and being called out for it, a brand could find its reputation damaged because of negative publicity. Loss of consumer trust: If a customer believes in your brand and then what they believe is found to be incorrect, it will be difficult to regain that trust. Legal and ethical implications: Many countries have strict regulations against misleading environmental claims. Failure to comply with these could lead to lawsuits or fines. Consumer backlash: Social media can be a marketer‚Äôs best friend, but it can also be their worst enemy. Through word-of-mouth marketing, people can share information about a company‚Äôs greenwashing activities, which can go viral. Loss of competitive edge: Brands accused of greenwashing may struggle to compete with other companies in the industry that adopt transparent and genuine sustainability. Investor and partner distrust: Investors and business partners may see greenwashing as an unethical practice, leading to lost opportunities.

"The ‚Äúbuy local‚Äù movement just got its biggest boost in decades ‚Äì from Trump tariffs. Why aren‚Äôt progressives cheering? https://preview.redd.it/p2voljt0erye1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d15ea3087063c598648283fe9b0518a52caa9aa6 Until yesterday, I hadn‚Äôt considered where my potting soil came from. Usually when I visit Home Depot the only time I thought about saving the planet was when I was forced to park between a 7.3 liter Ford Powerstroke Diesel pickup and a 600 HP Range Rover SE which gets 16 mpg. Florida man drives the Ford, and NY retirees love the Range Rover. The bag of potting soil I bought yesterday was virtue signaling with all its might: *‚Äúmanufactured less than 150 miles from this retailer‚Äù.* Well, that‚Äôs nice. At least it‚Äôs not coming from the People‚Äôs Republic of Wuhan China, or some town in North Ontario. Reduced transportation costs and lower carbon footprint. Save the planet! Then, on the internet, I saw the picture at top. Empty docks and thousands of idle 18 wheelers at the port of Los Angeles. No cargo to haul. Container ships are staying in their home ports, instead of queueing offshore of Los Angeles like they usually do. Trains are probably idled too. And cargo flights are getting grounded, Hat trick! And all because of Trump‚Äôs tariffs? Progressives don‚Äôt seem to be cheering. They‚Äôve pivoted from ‚Äúbuy local‚Äù to *‚ÄúTrump is a maniac who's making my conspicuous consumption more expensive‚Äù.* Media criticism of Trump is an echo chamber of things like ‚ÄúAI image of Trump dressed as Pope creates outrage‚Äù, and ‚ÄúSome guy in Australia re-elected Prime Minister after saying he hates Trump‚Äù. The president isn‚Äôt getting dissed for real stuff - like adding to the federal debt, or his foreign policy fiascos. Trump wore a blue suit to the Pope‚Äôs funeral, and now there's that damn fake Trump pic as pope. At least he wasn‚Äôt wearing a white puffer jacket, eh? The whole point of the buy local movement *‚Äúis to create a thriving local economy by maximizing the potential of local businesses and increasing their market share‚Äù.* Stop cursing me out - that's a quote from their web site . . . those aren't my words. Okay . . . we now appear to be arriving at our destination. The price of that Ford Powerstroke Diesel is going to rise because of the 25% tariffs on any parts made in Chinese Siberia and Chiapas Mexico. The entire Range Rover SE will be subject to tariffs. The elites living in New York, New England, and California are losing their minds. They can‚Äôt possibly be seen driving a made-in-America Honda Passport. What will their McMansion neighbors think? When I got my bag of potting mix home (I‚Äôm not telling you which brand), it was awful. It looked like stuff that had been run through a wood chipper less than a month ago. There were Q-tip sized sticks of wood, and other lumpy debris throughout. That‚Äôs not to say Canadian or Chinese mulch would have been better. The last time I bought dog food made in China it was recalled because it had asbestos in it. I‚Äôm just sayin‚Äô . . .

Das zeigt eine Untersuchung, die von einem √ñkostromanbieter in Auftrag gegeben wurde. Demnach treiben hohe Energiepreise und fehlender Wettbewerb den Stromer-Kilometerpreis in die H√∂he, w√§hrend das Netz derzeit kaum ausgelastet ist. [H\_Ko \/ shutterstock.com](https://preview.redd.it/78v489hgb28f1.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d54207e65735df8f8a88308031fc65c4e0402336) # Laden ist teuer geworden Das Laden von Elektroautos an √∂ffentlichen Stationen ist oft teurer als herk√∂mmliches Tanken. Laut dem √ñkostromanbieter Lichtblick zahlen Fahrer im Durchschnitt etwa 10,45 Euro f√ºr 100 Kilometer an Normallades√§ulen, w√§hrend Schnelllades√§ulen mit rund 12,06 Euro noch kostspieliger sind. F√ºr die gleiche Strecke mit einem Benziner fallen etwa zehn Euro an. ‚ÄûDie Preisentwicklung an √∂ffentlichen Lades√§ulen beobachten wir seit Jahren mit Sorge‚Äú, so der Lichtblick-Jurist Markus Adam. ‚ÄûDass die Preise inzwischen dauerhaft h√∂her sind als die f√ºr Benzin und Diesel, ist ein R√ºckschlag f√ºr die Verkehrswende.‚Äú Das Energieunternehmen f√ºhrt die hohen Preise vor allem auf mangelnden Wettbewerb zur√ºck. Es gebe kaum Konkurrenz und kleinere Anbieter w√ºrden benachteiligt. Fahrstromanbieter sind meist die lokalen Energieversorger, ‚Äûdie mit dem √∂rtlichen Stromnetzbetreiber konzernrechtlich verbunden oder selbst Stromnetzbetreiber sind‚Äú. So haben sie faktisch freie Hand bei der Preisgestaltung. # Lokale Energieversorger dominieren Markt Der Bericht ist bereits der achte ‚ÄûLades√§ulencheck‚Äú von Lichtblick. F√ºr die Auswertung hat der Datendienstleister Statista im Auftrag des √ñkostromversorgers aktuelle Tarife f√ºhrender Betreiber von √∂ffentlichen Lades√§ulen analysiert. Dabei wurden die Preise pro Kilowattstunde f√ºr Normalladepunkte (AC) und Schnellladepunkte (DC) ber√ºcksichtigt, basierend auf einem durchschnittlichen Verbrauch von 20 kWh pro 100 Kilometer. Die Ergebnisse des ‚ÄûChecks‚Äú zeigen, dass das Laden an √∂ffentlichen Lades√§ulen h√§ufig teurer ist als das Betanken eines Verbrennungsfahrzeugs. Zudem offenbart die Analyse, dass lokale Energieversorger den Markt dominieren und so entscheidenden Einfluss auf Preise und Konditionen haben. Wer einen Vertrag direkt mit einem Schnellladeanbieter hat, profitiert zwar h√§ufig von g√ºnstigeren Preisen beim Schnellladen unterwegs, die Auswahl an solchen Lades√§ulen ist aber meist eingeschr√§nkt. Kunden ohne Vertrag k√∂nnen zwar ebenfalls laden, zahlen daf√ºr aber oft einen Aufschlag in Form von Roaming-Geb√ºhren. # Ladenetz mit der Leistung von vier Atomkraftwerken In Deutschland sollen gesetzliche Vorgaben f√ºr einen fairen Zugang und mehr Transparenz beim Laden sorgen. Dennoch wird seit Jahren kritisiert, dass diese Regeln kaum Wirkung zeigen. Ein Grund daf√ºr ist, dass E-Auto-Fahrer unterwegs h√§ufig keine freie Wahl des Stromanbieters haben. Bereits 2024 warnte das Bundeskartellamt vor fehlendem Wettbewerb und m√∂glichen Preissteigerungen wegen Lade-Roamings. Die schwarz-rote Koalition will den Ausbau der Ladeinfrastruktur mit Milliarden f√∂rdern. Fachleute warnen jedoch, dass viele Lades√§ulen derzeit [kaum ausgelastet sind](https://www.geblitzt.de/news/ladesaeulen-flaute-e-auto-infrastruktur-bleibt-ungenutzt/). Laut [spiegel.de](http://spiegel.de) besteht sogar ein √úberangebot an Ladegelegenheiten. Nach Angaben der Bundesnetzagentur waren im Dezember des vergangenen Jahres bereits mehr als 154.000 √∂ffentliche Ladepunkte mit einer Gesamtnennleistung von √ºber 5,5 Gigawatt in Betrieb.

"[No Spoilers] How do you get into Critical Role? Kind of a weird question I guess, but how do you guys get into the series? I've been a long off-again-on-again DM, who has loved the rather unexpected dive into D&amp;D and the culture around it. My wife got me the books, we started some campaigns with friends, watched Harmon Quest, assorted YouTube, etc, and love it all. The Vin Diesel guest episode for CR is a favorite to show people what D&amp;D can be like. And honestly I love the community built around CR. I love the characters as I understand them, the development they apparently go through. The quotes, fanimations, and discussions found here and elsewhere is TTRPG gold and I eagerly consume everything. But for whatever reason, I just can't seem to sit down and actually watch the damn thing. In theory this should be my jam, and really everything surrounding the story, characters, and brand speaks to me really well, but every time I pull it up on YouTube I just don't find my footing with it before moving on. I've made it I think to episode 3 in as many sittings, and I tell myself ""oh man, these characters are great, this setting is cool, the actors are all having a good fun time"" but it doesn't quite stick. Idk. I'm not averse to long winded content usually, so I'm not sure if it's just something I'm doing wrong? I'm looking forward to the Amazon series or whatever that's going to be, and I've picked up the Origins book to go through to see if that helps, but honestly I have a decent idea of the characters and their personalities at this point and like them, so not sure if that's it.

"Another PSA: Be very careful with the Raine e-scooter campaign on Kickstarter Howdy folks! In the past month or so I've seen a few different posts here, asking about the new [Raine scooter offered on Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/raine-scooters/the-raine-one-electric-scooter). Given this obvious interest in the Raine scooter, I'd like to take a second to reiterate [my previous warning](https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricScooters/comments/cy1fj8/psa_be_very_careful_when_backing_escooter/) from a couple months ago; this time in direct reference to the Raine campaign. And I'm going to annoyingly do so in all caps to drive home the point: **CROWDFUNDED E-SCOOTER CAMPAIGNS HAVE A DUBIOUS HISTORY! BE VERY, VERY CAREFUL (AND SKEPTICAL) BEFORE BACKING!!!** Let me be very clear: I am NOT saying that the Raine campaign is a scam, nor am I saying that they definitely won't deliver. I *can't* say those things because I don't know that those things are true. But I *do* know that I see some typical red flags with Raine. Specifically: 1. Raine is a company with NO track record. None. Zilch. Zip. Nada. They may very well be legit, but the thing is...nobody knows that. People will often see a fancy campaign with slick videos and *think* that means the company must be legit. But that really doesn‚Äôt mean jack or shit. Hell, Eon had a [slick and pretty campaign site](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/eon-scooter-the-most-affordable-electric-scooter#/) too. And that Eon e-scooter crowdfunding campaign was a [total and complete scam](https://forums.letskickscoot.com/?forum=410212). Don't assume that because they have a nice campaign website, everything is kosher. I *was* able to determine that Raine is a subsidiary or brand of Enova Design Pty Ltd. That is an Australian design/marketing company that appears to have no specialized skills in engineering. This is not a dispositive finding, but it does mean ""be careful"". 2. Raine's campaign financing goal was only $50K. The problem? It‚Äôs takes *a lot* more money than that to develop and bring to market a brand new scooter from scratch. So, how did Raine finance the original development of the scooter? And why are they only now - supposedly just weeks away from production - asking for a measly $50K??? I would need to hear a coherent, logical response to this question. 3. I did not see where Raine lists the motor or battery specs; two of the most important things to consider when buying a scooter. Would you buy a car not knowing what type of engine it had, or not knowing whether it took gasoline or diesel (or was electric)? Of course you wouldn‚Äôt. So why would you even consider backing a scooter without knowing much about the motor or battery? 4. Raine uses several meaningless, gibberish buzzwords to hype the product. Like ""Brushless Flux Drive"". What the hell is a ""flux"" drive? And a ""Poly-shock suspension""? Without technical details, these words are worthless. Or worse. In sum, Raine's campaign page is heavy on performance promises but very light on any actual technical details. 5. The Raine scooter specs sound ""too good to be true"". **31mph/50kmh and 25miles/40km of range at 26 pounds?** Ima going to call ""bullshit"" on that. That's *CLOSE* to possible, but the industry is not quite there IMO. Likewise, they claim to have built-in navigation, heated grips, ""aluminum carbon fiber composite"" construction (whatever that is), ABS (which isn't real ABS) and a ""patented"" lock feature (may I see the patent number, please?). And a pair of gloves and shipping are included in the $979 price. Again, all of this is *CLOSE* to being possible, but not quite yet and not quite at this price point. 6. Raine claims they did a ""first production test run"" in September 2019, but they also say they are still ""open to ideas on product development"". I have enough knowledge of tooling up and manufacturing to know that once you get to a point where production runs are already occurring, it's difficult to make",Rebel,Diesel,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricScooters/comments/dvi0np/another_psa_be_very_careful_with_the_raine/

Overall it's quite nice for the price I would recommend 8.5/10 CH Keychain Link: https://www.pandabuy.com/product?url=PJ1vr0f2Oq2sti2KHDE%2B2sc18yJER%2FoZA4sKzXLPTz3t%2F75PgDSI%2F9X7BtyX2K%2FgiNheTA%3D%3D&amp;utm_source=orderList&amp;utm_medium=pdb&amp;utm_campaign=normal Cost: 7.74$ with shipping to the warehouse Just a nice piece. No problems with it at all but I wish I would open a little bit more. Overall a cheap nice CH piece 10/10 Carhartt Vista Hoodie Link: https://detail.tmall.com/item.htm?id=743682855518 Cost: 28$ I am impressed with that one. Nice thick heavy hoodie. It's warm and really comfy, might be the best feeling hoodie in my wardrobe and my new favorite. Patch is good no problems with that. Tag on the neck is quite bad, washtag is okay but I don't care. It fits big so watch out for that I copped an M and it's a bit oversized which is perfect for me.

Material is nice, close to retail but maybe a bit thinner. Those feel really good. Button is branded which is nice zipper feels good patch is also good. There's no inside tag but who would've care. It has like a worn down effect on the edges of pockets and bottom of the leg I accually don't know if retail ones have this but it looks nice. The one and only flaw is poor stiching in some places.

"From eBay to $2M/month Hey - Pat from [StarterStory.com](https://www.starterstory.com) here with another interview. Today's interview is with Tyler Robertson of [Diesel Laptops](https://www.diesellaptops.com), a brand that sells B2B products to the trucking and off-highway diesel industry market **Tyler is also a longtime redditor, /u/jtr8178 and a regular on r/entrepreneuer, so plz don't flame him too much :)** **Some stats:** * Product: Diesel diagnostic tools. * Revenue/mo: $2M * Started: May 2015 * Location: Gilbert, SC * Founders: 1 * Employees: 90 ### Hello! Who are you and what business did you start? My name is Tyler Robertson, and I‚Äôm the founder and CEO of [Diesel Laptops](https://www.diesellaptops.com/). We are a B2B company, and our business is selling diesel diagnostic hardware, software, and services to the trucking and off-highway diesel industry market. The business originally was started with the idea of making it easier for customers to purchase the products and services they needed. As time went on, I started to create our own software and services that would support the customers. Since I quit my ‚Äúregular‚Äù job to launch this company, we‚Äôve successfully doubled revenue each year. In three short years, it went from me in my dining room table and garage to a 21,000 square foot facility with over 90 employees. ### What's your backstory and how did you come up with the idea? I had worked at commercial truck dealerships for my entire career. Through those years, I‚Äôve seen commercial trucks become more and more complex, and more difficult to diagnose. Customers kept asking me how they can perform their own diagnostics, or get their own repair information. All of this was confusing, difficult, and expensive for a customer to figure out on their own. One day back in 2012, I found a person in Canada that made this great little software program. While it was focused on commercial trucks, it would also work with automotive, farm tractors, and some off highway equipment as well. It would read and clear codes, view live data, print some great reports, and basically allow the user to do basic troubleshooting on electronic system on these vehicles. [First kit sold on eBay in 2012 (link below)](//s3.amazonaws.com/www.starterstory.com/story_images/images/000/000/407/original/open-uri20181130-4-i5ok4o?1543545953) I emailed this person and asked if I could put a kit together, which included a laptop, his software, and then the hardware to interface with the equipment. He agreed, and I put one on eBay to see if it would sell. A couple days later it did, and then I just started adding more content to it and raising the price. I ended up doing this for about 3 years while I was working full-time for someone else. While that original kit has been upgraded many times, we still [continue to sell it on eBay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Universal-Diesel-Truck-Diagnostic-Laptop-Tool-Scanner-Complete-Kit-with-Laptop/231977745581). In early 2015, my then current employer asked me to make a decision -- Quit my side business and take a nice raise and bonus, or resign. At the time, my wife was a stay at home mom, and I had a 1-year old and 3-year old. I was making a great salary, and I had been with this company for almost 10 years. I was going to quit the side business, but my wife really urged me to give it a shot. We had been pretty frugal with our money and had saved a bunch up, so I took her advice and resigned.

We just landed [#422 on the Top 5000 fastest growing companies](https://www.inc.com/profile/diesel-laptops) in America, and quickly have moved from my garage and dining room table to a 21,000 square foot building.

"BMW EGR recall in UK Have 520d G30 and this car is currently in the recall campaign for EGR in UK. In 2022 BMW have done some preventative software update and recently send me a letter saying that the car is awaiting parts replacement. However last week while driving down M3 a sudden Drivetrain message came up, saying that there is issue and performance reduced. On arriving home a quick scan shoved few codes all EGR related. Worst was yet to be seen as I opened the bonnet and took engine cover off and found a lot of carbon buildup around EGR. Contacted BMW UK, been told my nearest center will get in touch within 2 days, they never did. Drove car to them myself, after explaining what is what been told to bring car back in 2 weeks for just diagnostic. Told them this is definitely EGR and insisted on their mechanic to look under the bonnet and advise if it‚Äôs safe to drive and that the car won‚Äôt catch fire. Mechanic confirmed all my worries and said that the car should be looked at ASAP and not be driven. When I said that I‚Äôm happy to leave the car but in return I need courtesy vehicle (as this is the only one I have) been told they can‚Äôt help me with it and do not provide courtesy cars. Had to raise complain now with BMW UK and take the car with leaking EGR that‚Äôs been advised not to be driven. Since when is BMW costumer service is a bag of s*ite? How is this considered a luxury brand? Unbelievable. Sorry for long text.

"[HIRING] Looking for multiple artists to help define the art style of fantasy campaign setting, MISTGATE (total project budget approx. $2,500) **Thank you everyone for your interest!** It will take us a bit of time to go through the responses to this hiring post, so please bear with us. If you've reached out to us, we'll try to get back to you within the week (2-3 days turn around time). --- Hello! My name is Sean Quinn (u/seanwquinn, [@seanwquinn](https://twitter.com/seanwquinn)) and I am the founder of a small one-person company Extesla LLC that is working on a project which I am hiring artists for and that I hope will turn into a medium-to-long term working relationship with the artists hired. I was informed about and directed to this community from r/DnD. **ABOUT THE PROJECT:** I have been writing a campaign setting that is compatible with Dungeons &amp; Dragons' 5th edition rules. The setting, _MISTGATE_, contains a significant amount of lore in addition to supplemental rules, character options, new items, etc. In fact the primary work (the campaign setting) is only a portion of all the content that has been written. It is best described as ""fantasy meets near-modern science fiction"" so I have typically just referred to it as a Science-Fantasy setting, a term just about as broad as ""fantasy"" and ""science fiction"" themselves. There are aspects of diesel-punk in parts of the setting and in others it has a more high-fantasy feel to it. In general though, most of the setting feels like it is in the middle of a transitional period of history where a rennaissance of magic is taking place and new ideas are being explored on a daily basis. The story of the world is set against a backdrop of exploration, ancient ruins dot the landscape--reminders of a lost history and a catastrophic event that nearly destroyed the world thousands of years ago. War and conflict are ever in the background and the return of magic has brought with it awesome and terrifying monsters. The text for the campaign setting is mostly complete (about 95% of it), I have begun working on editing and we have a few small groups play testing the content. Before I move on to laying out the project, I'm looking for artists that I can work with to really help bring life to the world. I've been working with a few friends to help manage this side of things, and I have an art director--PJ Morrand--who will be helping me work with artists. While those of us already involved in the effort have been doing this on our own time without compensation, we're looking to hire and pay artists working with us fairly. We have an initial sum of money already earmarked for the effort of hiring and paying artists. We intend to crowd fund this effort to raise more money for additional art (among other expenses) beyond this first, initial round. We are hoping to find artists that we can develop a good working relationship with and bring continued opportunities of work to for this project and others. Artists that we work with early on in the project will have a lot of influence in the art style and feel of the setting, your work will define the aesthetic for future art and projects related to _MISTGATE_. We're hoping to work with artists who fall in love with the setting as much as we have and might have a desire to contribute or get involved in other ways beyond producing art for the project. You can find all of the details in [this post on Lorecall](https://lorecall.com/blog/mistgate/searching-for-artists) (https://lorecall.com/blog/mistgate/searching-for-artists) about what we are looking for by way of art talent for _MISTGATE_, but what it boils down to is that we're looking for one or more artists with the following skills: (1) We're looking for a **graphic designer** that could help us create more-technical art pieces like maps, iconography, and incidental graphics. Especially, we're looking for someone who can help design a logo for the _MISTGATE_ campaign setting and brand.

"There should be a movie starring Vin Diesel and Terry Crews where they (and their group) play D&amp;D together, but it actually acts out the campaign, switching between the table and the setting, a-la ""The Princess Bride"". I've heard over and over that Vin Diesel and Terry Crews are big nerds who play D&amp;D. I've even heard they play together. Mr. Diesel also seems to have a lot of input into his movies, even having directed a few video games himself. I think with those two in there, there is the making of a phenomenal movie that alternates between a group of friends playing D&amp;D around a table that then has each of those actors playing their characters. Vin plays his character, Terry plays his, the others play their own. Whoever is DMing is also the narrator, and also plays all of the bad guys. It opens like it's an actual fantasy movie: Robert Downy Jr. (because that's who I picture in my head, I don't know if he's ever done anything like D&amp;D) is narrating something about our heroes journey, describing them each and how they came together, and the camera pans over a fantasy village. In walks, in fantasy costume, Terry Crews, Vin Diesel, The Rock, Matt Damon, and Patton Oswalt. Patton could play the halfling bard (who wouldn't want to hear him sing?), Matt Damon plays an annoying min-maxing elf who takes too long to do the math and doesn't role-play enough (when his character speaks, he sounds ""out of place"", think when a character talks in ""Drunk History""), and The Rock could be ""the new guy"" (playing an ironically physically weak wizard) at the table to guide the viewer through some of the basics. His charater is still jacked, but he can't do something simple like push a small boulder or lift a tiny wooden cart because his strength stat is 8. At the end of the introduction, Terry Crews objects to the description of what he is wearing. It cuts to a big table at one of their houses, everyone sitting around with their character sheets, the board in the middle has their pieces on a graph sheet. Dice everywhere. RDJ has his secret divider set up and the rule-book out in front of them, and they argue about their starting equipment for a minute. RDJ finally caves and it cuts back to the characters, and Terry's character is wearing the ""correct"" armor now. I would love to see that. The fantasy parts would be taken seriously like it's an acted out D&amp;D campaign, but it also has the realistic out-of-character relationships and discussions that make up a really important part of any campaign with friends. Plus, I want to see Terry Crews roll a dice, get a perfect 20 and get really excited and start yelling, then cut to Crews in full body armor swinging a broadsword and chopping off an ogre's head in one blow and still yelling, then cutting back to Crews IRL again standing up, yelling, then looking around awkwardly and realizing he got too excited. Every villian would be the DM (RDJ again I think just fits, he's just smug and arrogant but also friendly enough), the Ogre is a CGI RDJ, the thief in the hood is him, the big bad monster at the end has his voice. And of course, he's also the narrator. It has comedic potential, it has flashy action and CGI, it has big-name actors doing something ironically nerdy but somehow believable. I think it would make money, what with Hollywoods insistence on making a movie adaptation of everything, but I don't see a D&amp;D movie ever working without acknowledging that it's all still ""pretend"" on some level. Everyone knows D&amp;D, and I read recently that its use in ""Stranger Things"" has led to an increase in sales of D&amp;D stuff lately, so the timing is perfect, too!",Rebel,Diesel,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/52g657/there_should_be_a_movie_starring_vin_diesel_and/
"Details on how awful DMC2 is I've seen many people wondering specifics of how Devil May Cry 2 (featuring jeans from the Diesel brand) is so awful. I played through both the Dante and Lucia campaigns on normal difficulty, and now that we know for sure a playthrough isn't coming, I thought I'd share my findings. If anyone wants to add anything, feel free to lighten your burden. Obviously, guns are busted. We all saw what happens when you shoot a grounded enemy, but it goes beyond that. For extended periods of time, I found myself holding lock on and mashing the fire button to deal with enemies that were above the screen. Many bosses are immune to melee, out of melee reach, or a pain in the ass to fight up close, so you just spam Ebony and Ivory. There is no animation canceling that I could find. This was the biggest gripe for me. In DMC 1, you can cancel just about anything into a roll or a jump. Roll cancelling the reload of the grenade launcher fells great in DMC1! But you can't in DMC2, so I shelved the launcher immediately. In the DMC1 phantom fight, you can keep attacking its face until you see it wind up to attack with its claws, then immediately jump and use the i-frames to avoid the damage. You fight phantom again in DMC2, but this time you can't cancel out of your sword attacks. Phantom can wind up and attack in the space of Dante doing one attack, so you have to play extra safe. It feels awful. It also exacerbates the gun problem, since the animation of shooting E&amp;I is so short that it doesn't matter that you can't cancel out of it. There's a worse underwater section than DMC1. I'm not joking. Lucia has an extended (third person) swimming section. You move slow, and attack slower. You get an upgrade for your devil trigger that makes it so you move better underwater, and it STILL feels miserable. You even have to fight an underwater boss that turns invisible, and you can't lock on to it. This is what made the chance of me doing another playthrough on hard go from ""definitely not"" to ""AW HELL NO."" They touched on this in the brief look, but the devil arms you unlock are fucking boring. One has better range but worse damage, one has better damage but worse range. That's it. It has waves of enemies that go on so long I wonder if they're infinitely spawning. Attacking switches is a chore. They height they're at is such that from certain positions, only certain attacks hit high enough to make contact. I have no idea how they screwed this one up. Secret missions are boring now. You fight 2 small waves of enemies. They're not difficult, and you're not given any interesting challenges, like a time limit or having to not take damage. The big bad, Arius, has an actual has a cool moment. As I was fighting him, he summoned a demon and teleported away. After I beat the demon, I looked around the room for him, and found him leaning against his bar. That's awesome! He has a disinterested fighting style, his other moves include lazy revolver potshots and flicking cigars at you. Unfortunately, they go to far on the disinterest theme and forgot to make him concerned about defending himself against attacks. You can just wail on him with no repercussions, making the fight trivial. Story wise, Dante's campaign is just Lucia's with what few important plot points there are stripped out. Dante isn't told that Arius is after four arcana to make himself powerful, he just has them handed to him and then... gives them to Arius for some reason? Lucia is actually told what the arcana do and collects them in her stages. Lucia being told that she was created by Arius is exclusive to her campaign. It comes out of no where for Dante. Learning that Dante has been trolling everyone with a double-headed coin only happens in Lucia's campaign. All of these are important in contextualizing what happens in Dante's campaign, and nothing exclusive to Dante's campaign has any impact on Lucia's. Bafflingly, Lucia has the same exact character arc as Trish, wher",Rebel,Diesel,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/9i49vu/details_on_how_awful_dmc2_is/
"Frans Timmermans urges European left to unite against right‚Äôs climate backlash ‚Ä¢ Dutch politician and former EU deputy criticises ‚Äòastonishing‚Äô policy U-turns by countries including UK The former European Commission vice-president, who is leading the combined GreenLeft and Labour parties, believes progressives need to urgently mobilise against the radical right‚Äôs attempt to brand environmental reforms ‚Äútoo costly‚Äù. Speaking to the Guardian in one of his first campaign interviews, Timmermans said the UK government was one of the countries rowing back on green pledges. Rishi Sunak, the UK prime minister, announced a major U-turn on the government‚Äôs climate commitments last month, pushing back the deadline for selling new petrol and diesel cars and the phasing out of gas boilers. ‚ÄúI think the imminent danger is an attempt by the right to say ‚Äì and Sunak is a case in point ‚Äì ‚Äòwe cannot afford climate policy because it‚Äôs too costly, especially for people who don‚Äôt have a lot to spend‚Äô,‚Äù said Timmermans. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs quite astonishing to see people who generally have not shown a lot of consideration for people with low incomes to all of a sudden become the champions of people with low incomes, fighting climate policy,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúThey are doing it for clear economic interests. The threat to progressives, to the left, is that this contradiction between social justice and climate justice is exploited by the right and is divisive for the left.‚Äù",Rebel,Diesel,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/europes/comments/175360q/frans_timmermans_urges_european_left_to_unite/

EV APP OF THE WEEK: JUST PARK As well as helping drivers find parking spaces, the JustPark app also allows you to rent out your EV charging station if you have one at home. It‚Äôs an innovative way for EV owners to generate a little extra cash ‚Äî you can set your own price. As more charging points become available, more drivers may turn to electric vehicles, creating a more sustainable industry. ## 2. EV NEWS: INSIDE EVS Google Maps Is About To Get A Lot Better For EV Charging. Attention from the biggest name in navigation should help finding an EV charger suck just a little bit less. Artificial intelligence is everywhere now. It's all over earnings calls from companies trying to appear with the times. It's writing lazy high schoolers' essays. It's powering clunky new wearables that tech reviewers hate. Hype and buzzwords aside, some companies are actually putting AI to good use. ## 3. EV TIP: GET ADVICE FROM THE COMMUNITY Get advice from the EV community. My top tip when planning an EV journey is to take advice from other EV drivers who have been there before,‚Äù says Melanie Shufflebotham. ‚ÄúMost EV brands have a forum where you can seek advice from drivers of the same car, such as the Nissan Leaf Owners forum, the Kia e-Niro Owners forum and many more.‚Äù She continues: ‚ÄúAlso, when you are planning your journey, make sure you check out any comments from Zap-Map users for valuable info. On Zap-Map you can check out the chat channel on individual charge points, and you will see feedback on charge experience and other info, such as whether there is a coffee shop nearby ‚Äì plus pictures to help you locate the charger. ‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt forget to check-in on Zap-Map when you charge to help others!‚Äù ## 4.

[Just send a tweet to @ev\_cables](https://twitter.com/ev_cables) and put #EVTuesdays at the end so we can find it. Have a great week everyone and happy reading! ## 1. EV APP OF THE WEEK: CONNECTED KERB Probably the UK‚Äôs favourite charging app. We heard that electric vehicle drivers (that's you) hate charging apps because they‚Äôre not very user friendly and there‚Äôs too many to choose from. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôve built a charging app that you can rely on, day in day out. Welcome to the world of Connected Kerb. ## 2. EV NEWS: INSIDE EVS Tesla Cybertruck Cuts Power In Tug-Of-War Battle Against Diesel Chevy Silverado. When Tesla debuted its Cybertruck, it featured a video showing the electric truck easily beating the Ford F-150 in a tug-of-war contest. The was a lot of controversy surrounding the matchup though and there was even a hint of a rematch from Ford. However, Ford later backed down from challenging the Cybertruck in a tug-of-war challenge. ## 3. EV TIP: BACK UP CABLE The charging cables you can use during the trip may vary. For example, you may have to use standard wall sockets instead of charging stations in some places. This may lead to a need for both an adapter and a backup cable, so it is advisable to pack both before leaving home. ## 4. EV CHARGING: EV CHARGING POINT PAYG ZeroNet is the national charging network that delivers what EV drivers need. It neutralises range anxiety through simple, robust and reliable Charging Stations at locations drivers can trust. Drivers can eat, play, work or sleep while topping up their vehicles. Unlike other networks, drivers don't need to register, pay monthly fees or carry smart cards. The essence of ZeroNet is strictly pay-as-you-go. Drivers can simply pull up and plug in, trusting in charging stations that work every time. ## 5. EV REVIEW: CAR WOW *Seal BYD*The Seal is Chinese brand BYD‚Äôs third new car to launch across 2023, and like Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, to many it will be seen as by far the best of the three. With all due respect to the Atto 3 SUV and Dolphin hatchback, the Seal is a big step forward on either, and will find itself added to a shortlist of options that could already have contained the Tesla Model 3, BMW i4, Polestar 2 and Hyundai Ioniq 6.

Throughout his epic 19-year career, O‚ÄôNeal redefined the dominant ‚Äòbig man‚Äô role, tearing down backboards and racking up MVP accolades, all while moonlighting as a pop culture icon who would energize basketball subcultures for years to come. The signing of Shaquille ahead of his rookie season in 1992, would evolve into one of the most prolific and impactful athlete-brand partnerships in industry history. In the partnership‚Äôs first year Reebok introduced its first-ever signature shoe, the ‚Äú[Shaq Attaq](https://www.kicksonfire.com/tag/reebok-shaq-attaq/)‚Äù, followed by a host of irreverent and disruptive ad campaigns and product lines that set the stage for the brand‚Äôs on-court dominance during that era. _‚ÄúWe are thrilled to be expanding upon our partnership with Shaquille with this historic appointment.

On Zap-Map you can check out the chat channel on individual charge points, and you will see feedback on charge experience and other info, such as whether there is a coffee shop nearby ‚Äì plus pictures to help you locate the charger. ‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt forget to check-in on Zap-Map when you charge to help others!‚Äù ## 4.

While there‚Äôs an argument that running your old petrol or diesel car into the ground is better for the climate than buying a new electric vehicle (the answer depends on how the emissions are calculated), no one can deny that EVs have a more positive impact on the environment as a result of increased energy efficiency and zero tailpipe emissions compared to traditional cars Until next time.

"From eBay to $2M/month Hey - Pat from [StarterStory.com](https://www.starterstory.com) here with another interview. Today's interview is with Tyler Robertson of [Diesel Laptops](https://www.diesellaptops.com), a brand that sells B2B products to the trucking and off-highway diesel industry market **Tyler is also a longtime redditor, /u/jtr8178, so plz don't flame him too much :)** **Some stats:** * Product: Diesel diagnostic tools. * Revenue/mo: $2M * Started: May 2015 * Location: Gilbert, SC * Founders: 1 * Employees: 90 ### Hello! Who are you and what business did you start? My name is Tyler Robertson, and I‚Äôm the founder and CEO of [Diesel Laptops](https://www.diesellaptops.com/). We are a B2B company, and our business is selling diesel diagnostic hardware, software, and services to the trucking and off-highway diesel industry market. The business originally was started with the idea of making it easier for customers to purchase the products and services they needed. As time went on, I started to create our own software and services that would support the customers. Since I quit my ‚Äúregular‚Äù job to launch this company, we‚Äôve successfully doubled revenue each year. In three short years, it went from me in my dining room table and garage to a 21,000 square foot facility with over 90 employees. ### What's your backstory and how did you come up with the idea? I had worked at commercial truck dealerships for my entire career. Through those years, I‚Äôve seen commercial trucks become more and more complex, and more difficult to diagnose. Customers kept asking me how they can perform their own diagnostics, or get their own repair information. All of this was confusing, difficult, and expensive for a customer to figure out on their own. One day back in 2012, I found a person in Canada that made this great little software program. While it was focused on commercial trucks, it would also work with automotive, farm tractors, and some off highway equipment as well. It would read and clear codes, view live data, print some great reports, and basically allow the user to do basic troubleshooting on electronic system on these vehicles. [First kit sold on eBay in 2012 (link below)](//s3.amazonaws.com/www.starterstory.com/story_images/images/000/000/407/original/open-uri20181130-4-i5ok4o?1543545953) I emailed this person and asked if I could put a kit together, which included a laptop, his software, and then the hardware to interface with the equipment. He agreed, and I put one on eBay to see if it would sell. A couple days later it did, and then I just started adding more content to it and raising the price. I ended up doing this for about 3 years while I was working full-time for someone else. While that original kit has been upgraded many times, we still [continue to sell it on eBay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Universal-Diesel-Truck-Diagnostic-Laptop-Tool-Scanner-Complete-Kit-with-Laptop/231977745581). In early 2015, my then current employer asked me to make a decision -- Quit my side business and take a nice raise and bonus, or resign. At the time, my wife was a stay at home mom, and I had a 1-year old and 3-year old. I was making a great salary, and I had been with this company for almost 10 years. I was going to quit the side business, but my wife really urged me to give it a shot. We had been pretty frugal with our money and had saved a bunch up, so I took her advice and resigned.

"Everything about the Fallen Angel video Hi, I'm new to reddit so I don't know if should give a ""too much text"" warning but, well too much text alert. So, I watched the video today and thought ""hey, I've seen this guy with the make-up, I can't wait until he mentions how the video was made"" because I remember watching behind the scenes stuff in YouTube. So, it was weird that Gooseboose didn't find anything. I did some googling, for ""video Espa√±a angel ca√≠do"" which took me to this Vice article by Rub√©n moldes: [https://www.vice.com/es/article/mg4pw3/primeros-videos-virales-espana](https://www.vice.com/es/article/mg4pw3/primeros-videos-virales-espana) It's in Spanish of course, but you can google translate it. In short, it describes the impact the video had in Spain, and it includes fragments of a supposed interview with the creators, while keeping them anonymous, the article also mentions that the video was made by two guys in ""Campdev√†nol"". And by the way, the article also mentions how it was featured on a Mexican TV Show ""Tercer Milenio""; which I had absolutely forgotten about, but it terrified me as a kid, growing up I ended up finding it hilarious and being Mexican I often struggle to relate to most things in traumathon, so if gooseboose sees this and wants to talk about it I'm sure your Mexican (and probably the rest of Latin America) fans would love it. Anyway, knowing that it was made in campdevanol, I searched ""angel ca√≠do campdevanol Catalu√±a"", which showed a lot more, but I found this article from 2009 that for some reason I can only open in the mobile version of edge: [http://www.aeromental.com/2009/01/12/el-angel-caido-de-cataluna-era-un-fraude/](http://www.aeromental.com/2009/01/12/el-angel-caido-de-cataluna-era-un-fraude/). Again, it is in Spanish but in short, it's a little time capsule saying it was fake (surprise). It describes that the video was made to promote a brand named ""DIESEL"", here is a translated fragment of the page: &gt;""In the year 2006, on the 6th day of june (666) the best publicity of the clothing brand DIESEL was released. &gt; &gt;**With the topic of ""Fallen Angel"" they tried to say that angels ripped their wings off to go back to earth and be able to use their brand of clothes** &gt; &gt;In Spain, this was launched along with the video that a lot of people consider to be authentic; the viral spread of this was immediate mostly in Latin America where the Fallen angel by DIESEL publicity never reached, a lot of ""serious investigators"" gave their opinion on the authenticity of said video &gt; &gt;Even nowadays, a lot of people believe this video to show a being from another world"" In the middle of my research for the DIESEL brand and the fallen angel video, I found this old video ""debunking"" (I think?) the original video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tv5d7nB37Ds&amp;ab\_channel=ArcaneDevilXV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tv5d7nB37Ds&amp;ab_channel=ArcaneDevilXV) There you can see an actual video of the process (which I think was the thing I saw as a kid, probably). And after a lot more googling, I found this: [http://www.cocobongo.tv/fallen\_angel\_10/](http://www.cocobongo.tv/fallen_angel_10/) An actual page made allegedly by the creators of the original video, featuring pretty much everything there is to know about the video and the DIESEL campaign. It also features a freaking VR experience (which I do not have the ovaries to go through until the end so idk how spooky it is lmao), here is a picture of it in case there are any other cowards like me: [https://imgur.com/a/0s9Yg57](https://imgur.com/a/0s9Yg57).

"Jeep ¬Æ brand unveils a new web series released on the Jeep brand‚Äôs official YouTube channels , portraying the new Jeep Avenger‚Äôs journey through a set of four videos narrating real people stories. Four characters, each embodying one of the brand values of Freedom, Adventure, Authenticity and Passion, are the main protagonists of each episode. The new Jeep Avenger is the brand's first all-electric SUV and is now available also as an e-Hybrid version . It blends impressive technical features and capability with respect for the environment, perfectly encapsulating the brand‚Äôs four values. The Jeep ¬Æ brand was born more than 80 years ago during times of dire strain, and as a result, its identity was forged based on the four values of: freedom, adventure, authenticity, and passion. These are the universal values that define what the Jeep Brand is today, and which continue to guide the brand‚Äôs path towards the future. The new Avenger ‚Äì the first-ever fully electric Jeep vehicle ‚Äì is intended to stand out and reflect those brand's values. Unveiled a year ago, at the Paris Motor Show, the new Jeep Avenger, combines modernity and legacy, thanks to technologies that ensure superior capability without compromising environmental sustainability, and a compact yet spacious design that embodies the brand's essence in an ambitious vehicle, developed based on the brand's blueprint values: Freedom, Adventure, Authenticity and Passion. To showcase these attributes, the Jeep brand is currently distributing a new web series made up of four one-minute video episodes posted on YouTube. Each episode will revolve around one of the brand's four core values and will feature authentic and personal anecdotes from four Italian protagonists who take viewers on a journey to discover what the Jeep brand communicates through its vehicles, in line with the aspirations and ambitions of those who choose to trust their Jeep SUV. The initial episode takes viewers to the sky with Sandro Beni, in search of the meaning of Freedom ( Link ). As a parachutist, Sandro finds an indescribable sense of freedom in being one with his surroundings and feeling connected to nature. A feeling that the Jeep brand aims to ensure and prioritize owners, thanks to the new Avenger's environmental focus. Equipped with a 400-volt electric motor and a 54kWh battery, the new 100% electric Avenger blends high performance with zero carbon emissions. To provide the freedom that drivers desire, the Jeep brand has equipped its first 100% electric SUV with a 100kW fast charger, allowing for a minimum distance of 30 km after just three minutes of charging, and a battery recharge of 20% to 80% in just 24 minutes. The second episode focuses on Adventure ( Link ) and is set in the captivating mountainous surroundings of ‚ÄúGole della Valserra‚Äù in Umbria. It showcases Szilvia Rados as the leading character, a 44-year-old woman who loves to explore the beauty of nature. She explains her understanding of adventure, which can be compared to the feeling of falling in love, as it accelerates the heartbeat and evokes unique emotions. She demonstrates why her Avenger is an essential travel partner, from its built-in navigation system - including the smartphone wireless screen mirroring to set map instructions - to its technical capabilities like the ""Selec-Terrain¬Æ"" and ""Hill Descent Control"" features, which makes the driving experience even safer and more enjoyable, enabling her to access destinations that bring her to life despite the harsh conditions, driving along unpaved roads in the same way that she handles the precipitous lines of the canyon. One of the Jeep brand's most prominent values, undoubtedly, is Authenticity, which has its roots in a long-standing tradition that stems from being the pioneer of the 4x4 SUV, allowing ""the beauty of the idea to become reality"", quoting Umberto Dattola, the designer involved in the third episode of the series ( Link ).

The assessments evaluated brand resonance for the single value of patriotism, and the Jeep brand was identified as the best for meeting today‚Äôs patriotism challenges. ‚ÄúPatriotism is one of the most powerful values a brand can own.

""Being recognized as America's most patriotic brand for the 23rd consecutive year is a testament to our passionate owners and enthusiasts who whole-heartedly embrace the outdoor adventure and freedom that our Jeep 4x4s offer, which is second to no other,"" said Bill Peffer , senior vice president and head of Jeep brand North America . To determine the 2024 rankings, Brand Keys surveyed more than 7,460 consumers, 18 to 65 years of age, balanced for gender and political affiliation, assessed 1,381 brands in 143 B2C and B2B categories, using Brand Keys emotional engagement measures. The assessments evaluated brand resonance for the single value of patriotism, and the Jeep brand was identified as the best for meeting today's patriotism challenges. ""Patriotism is one of the most powerful values a brand can own. Jeep has primary ownership of that value, with a real emotional underpinning. Jeep has a history forged in the past and the present,"" said Robert Passikoff , president and founder of Brand Keys . ""And if there's such a thing as 'patriotic DNA,' it shows up in our Most Patriotic Brands emotional engagement assessments. In a more political and partisan marketplace, Jeep has been able to create a bond with all consumers, which is why Jeep shows up at the top of the list every year."" The Jeep brand and the USO are also marking 16 years together to help support and keep the members of the nation's military connected to everything that gives meaning to their service. More information can be found at USO.org .

"A Patagonia lifetime warranty story Some years ago, I was gifted a 33L Patagonia backpack by a relative. Since then, I've worn it basically every single day, taken it to multiple continents and even to risky events like protests. It's been the best backpack I've had, very practical, sturdy and reliable. But it was unavoidable that it would start showing some signs of wear after a few years, especially the handle stitching ended up half torn (though the handle was still usable). Yesterday, when I randomly came accross a Patagonia store, I figured I would test the so-called lifetime warranty of Patagonia's gear. I went to the teller with my backpack, showed the stitching damage and asked if this would be covered under their warranty program. I was expecting a long and annoying process proof of purchase verification and online forms, but the salesperson just said they would replace the whole bag since this exact model had received an upgrade to a newer generation. So I ended up walking out with a brand new improved backpack, without paying a dime or providing a single receipt. Honestly, I'm still in awe. Patagonia stuff is expensive that's for sure, but I just got a new backpack free of charge that will probably last me for years. I would've been fine with just a quick stitching fix (and it would've been the most eco-friendly solution), but I really like this level of commitment towards their clients. Let's just hope my old backpack will be properly recycled while I enjoy this new one !",Explorer,Patagonia,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/PatagoniaClothing/comments/1mar336/a_patagonia_lifetime_warranty_story/
"A List of Mid-Priced Brands to Know - Graduating from Uniqlo ‚ÄúMid-priced‚Äù is a bit of a misnomer since I am comparing it to high fashion and luxury (e.g. [YSL](https://www.ysl.com/en-us/pr/biker-jacket-in-grained-lambskin-822089YCOQ21000.html) or [Loro Piana](https://www.mrporter.com/en-us/mens/product/loro-piana/clothing/winter-coats/double-breasted-cashmere-coat/1647597292356693)). Think of this list as ‚Äúhigh end but for normal people‚Äù. I think that the mid-priced tier is a good compromise between price, fashion, and quality. Brands on this list will generally be higher quality than the mall brands; they typically use higher end materials (mostly natural fibers, except for the technical garments which use high performance synthetics). Many of them are made in first world countries with better labor and sustainability practices. I organized the brands into various categories and provided the country that each brand is based (not necessarily where they are made). I also show price tiers for each of them relative to their category. Keep in mind this is just my opinion. I left off footwear (which would be a pretty extensive list too) and accessories. 395 brands is already so many! Feel free to ask about the brands or offer any critique or comments!

"So Patagonia got bullied on Instagram after making a political post. What is the story with Lost Arrow Project ? Long story short Patagonia made a political post about the environment, everyone in the comments brought up their military contracts. They proceeded to leave one comment claiming they ""sold that division 2 years ago"". When further questioned about this claim they deleted the post. So does anyone know what the full story is with the Lost Arrow Project? The entire thing is extremely vague and shady. From my understanding Lost Arrow Corporation was the holding company for Patagonia and all it's ventures and investments. But no longer is as of the last couple of years ? And they of course had the Lost Arrow Project under the Patagonia brand.

"""Sustainable clothing brand Patagonia manufactures in the same factories as fast-fashion; textile workers are being exploited"" The Dutch independent investigative journalism platform 'Follow the Money' wrote a article about Patagonia. **""Sustainable clothing brand Patagonia manufactures in the same factories as fast-fashion; textile workers are being exploited""** **Clothing brand Patagonia seems to be doing everything right: for its employees, for the people who make the clothes and for the environment. The company‚Äôs image ‚Äì they say they‚Äôre in business to save our home planet ‚Äì is very different from fast-fashion brands like asos, Primark and Nike. But Patagonia‚Äôs clothes are manufactured in exactly the same factories and under the same deplorable conditions.** When Yvon Chouinard started creating climbing equipment in his parents‚Äô backyard in Burbank, California, he used steel. Soon he earned a reputation for making the ‚Äòbest‚Äô climbing equipment in America. But every time a climber slammed one of those steel pegs into a rock, the gap got a little bigger and eventually unusable. Chouinard realised he was making money by destroying the rocks and therefore also the sport. And so he switched to aluminium blocks, which did not damagethe rocks. The change was expensive and risky for the young company, but the moral dilemma was reason enough for Chouinard to implement the change. And to be very outspoken about it. It was a success: within a year, 40 per cent of the US climbing community stopped using steel. Chouinard applied this experience when he started the outdoor brand Patagonia in 1973. He wanted to make only high-quality clothing that would last. And limit the impact on the environment as much as possible. In 1996, the brand switched to 100 per cent organic cotton, only to increasingly replace it with recycled materials. But the responsibility that Chouinard attributed to the company extended further. In 2002 he decided to give one per cent of sales to environmental organisations every year. In 2011, Patagonia placed a full-page ad in the New York Times calling on consumers to ‚Äònot buy this jacket‚Äô in order to draw attention to the problematic nature of overconsumption in the clothing industry. In addition, the clothing had to be manufactured fairly: in 2012, the top of the company made paying living wages to everyone who makes Patagonia products a ‚Äòpriority‚Äô. In 2020, Patagonia launched a campaign encouraging consumers to demand more from clothing brands: ‚Äò*Demand recycled. Demand organic. Demand Fair Trade,‚Äô* Patagonia urged its viewers. In 2022, the then 84-year-old Chouinard caused worldwide astonishment, when he gave away 98 per cent of his shares to a newly formed NGO, the Holdfast Collective, which is ‚Äòcommitted in its fight against the environmental crisis and protecting nature.‚Äô Henceforth, the company‚Äôs profits would no longer flow to himself or his children but to the climate. ‚ÄòEarth is now our only shareholder,‚Äô Chouinard said. *Billionaire gives company away to climate*, newspapers like [*The New York Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/14/climate/patagonia-climate-philanthropy-chouinard.html;)*,* [*The Washington Post* ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2022/09/14/patagonia-yvon-chouinard-climate-change/)and [*The Guardian*](https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/sep/15/yvon-chouinard-the-existential-dirtbag-who-founded-and-gifted-patagonia) reported\*.\* This construction saved the NGO an estimated 700 million dollars that Chouinard would have had to pay in tax if he had sold the company and donated the proceeds to the same NGO. But according to Chouinard, this option allowed him to do something else: protect Patagonia‚Äôs values. Because he did not give the voting shares to Holdfast Collective but to a family trust. This allows his family to continue determining the company‚Äôs direction. The company‚Äôs turnover ‚Äì its European headquarters are in Amsterdam ‚àí grew by more than 50 per cent that ",Explorer,Patagonia,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/PatagoniaClothing/comments/145wqua/sustainable_clothing_brand_patagonia_manufactures/
"Which luggage brands are up there in terms of commitments to sustainability like Patagonia? Maybe Monos? I have a Monos front pocket one and have loved it so far. Been a lurker here and wanting to ask around. The thing I appreciate about Monos is they are part of 1% for the Planet and Climate Neutral certified. I recently learnt this from visiting their store in Vancouver. Always been a big fan of Patagonia, so love it when brands use these commitments as a part of their story telling and selling points. The store staff also told me they are working on their B-Corp application. The staff actually went on and told me how both 1% for the Planet and Climate Neutral worked. 1% Monos donates 1% of their revenue (not profits!) to different environmental organizations and climate neutral is by offsetting carbon emissions with donations. I was thinking to myself this is a lot of money. They also mentioned how its part of their operations as well, so in addition with using sustainable materials and all that, they look to reduce emissions and shipping as much as possible - eg: they would ask customers to not ship back items in certain cases to reduce the back and forth shipping and just give them a refund or an exchange. Haven't seen this personally yet, but anyone had that experience? I am wondering if there are any other luggage brands that does or talks about sustainability like this?

"Coworker wanted to borrow my watch?

Thursday Derek cornered me again: ‚ÄúFine, but if we lose this deal because I couldn‚Äôt borrow a mid-tier watch, that‚Äôs on you.‚Äù The comeuppance We flew to Austin Sunday night. Monday morning, Derek strode into the hotel lobby puffed up with confidence‚Äîand, sure enough, a Tissot PRX gleaming on his wrist.

"What snowboard brands are still privately owned? This question crossed my mind recently and I started doing some googling and I was surprised to learn that some of my favorite ""core"" brands are actually owned by giant investment firms or corporations. In general, as a lover of this sport, I want to support the smaller, rider owned and operated brands with my dollar when it comes time to buy new gear. Take Volcom for example. Volcom is a brand I always considered ""core"" and cool with a rad team, but they're actually owned by Authentic Brands, which [now owns the Boardriders](https://thedaily.outdoorretailer.com/news/brands-and-retailers/authentic-brands-closes-boardriders-acquisition/#:~:text=The%20New%20York%2Dbased%20brand,to%20a%20licensing%20operating%20model) group (Quicksilver, Roxy, DC, Billabong, plus a few others). This now puts Volcom and Quicksilver next to brands like David Beckham, Frye, Forever 21, Izod, Nautica, and Spyder. [Link to Authentic Brands' portfolio](https://corporate.authentic.com/brands) Another example, Mervin. I always thought of Lib and Gnu as rad, independent, rider owned brands but no. Apparently (according to [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mervin_Manufacturing#:~:text=Mervin%20was%20purchased%20by%20Quiksilver,was%20purchased%20by%20Altamont%20Capital)) they were bought by Quicksilver in the late 90s, and by Altamont Capital in 2014. Colored me surprised. I found this pretty funny, especially after T Ricky's That's it That's All part where the Lib logo is peeing on a Burton logo, when Burton is actually still privately owned. So final example is Burton, which I know is still privately owned. Say what you will about them being ""core"" or not, but I think the fact they've chosen to stay private is rad and a positive for our industry. I personally think they have deservedly lost a lot of respect from the community with various moves like buying up brands to drop them later, *cough* *Forum* *cough,* but they do continue to invest in putting out solid products and supporting rad riders. Anyways, I'm just wondering if anyone has a solid list of who is still privately (and ideally rider) owned in the snowboard industry. I managed to find a 12 yr old [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/snowboarding/comments/m4di1/snowboarding_who_owns_who_jpg/) that linked to a cool [info graphic](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Q5GWc46SESE/S118yx6JbgI/AAAAAAAAB3w/4qn2AchkQzg/s1600-h/Brand-Map.jpg) and I would love to see a current version of this. EDIT: To the best of my knowledge, these are the brands I believe are still privately owned (I'll try to keep this updated): * 1910 * 686 * Academy * Aesmo (Is Wolfgang independent of Salomon??) * Airblaster * Amplid * Ashbury * Beyond Medals * Bluebird Wax * Bombhole * Borealis Snowboards * Burton * C3 * Capita * Coal * Union * Cardiff Snowcraft * Chimera Snowboards * Coiler Custom Alpine Snowboards * Crab Grab * Custom Cult snowboards * Damaged Inc. * Dang Shades * Deviation Works * Dinosaurs Will Die * Donek * D.O.P.E Industries (the swaggy homies from up north, not that lame insta brand) * Douk Snowboards * DRIFT boards * Drink Sexy (shout out for the cooked homies) * Dupraz Snowboards * Elevated Surf Craft * Endeavor Snowboards * Gilson * Glade Optics * Goon Gear * FlameTec * FLUX bindings * Franco Snowshapes * Friday Snowboard Co. * Fuberg Snowboards * Gentemstick * Howl * Karakoram * Kemper (relaunched in 2018 by a rider - [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kemper_Snowboards)) * Killdeath * KNWN Mfg * Korua Shapes * Lago Snowboards * Marhar * Moonchild Snowboards * Moron Wax * Moss Snowstick * MTN Approach * MTN Local Snowboards * Nerd Snowboards * Never Summer * NICHE * Nidecker Group * Flow * Jones * Nidecker * Now * YES * Low Pressure Studios [link to acquisition article](https://www.boardsportsource.com/big-wig-interview-nidecker-brothers-make-major-acquisition-moves/) * Bataleon * Lobster * Switchback * Rome SDS * Nitro * Autumn * Corduroy * Eivy * L1 Premiu",Explorer,Patagonia,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/snowboarding/comments/17hyqdu/what_snowboard_brands_are_still_privately_owned/
"Indefinite 32L One Bag Travel - 27+ countries over the next 13ish months with a single backpack Cross posting from r/onebag. Beginning in September I‚Äôve decided to live indefinitely out of a 32L backpack while traveling the globe. I‚Äôm a decently experienced traveler, have lived abroad, and got to do the digital nomad thing for a time - all this to say that I‚Äôm fairly confident going into this trip. My last lengthy one bag stint featured the Matador SEG30 (discontinued, but I still have mine and love it dearly) was in 2022; I visited 11 countries in around 6 months, working all the while. I actually cataloged some of my adventures on this account, including my original packing list! Fun memories to dig up and very interesting to compare my packing list now. This time around I‚Äôll be doing some more adventurous travel and leaving behind my DN-friendly work setup. I‚Äôve upgraded a lot of my gear, but there are still some proven winners from my last long trip; I tagged them in the packing list. THE PLAN: Complete 7-ish phases of travel across 27+ countries and end up in Australia/NZ around September/October 2026 * Baltics (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland) * Balkans (Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, Montenegro, Albania, North Macedonia, Serbia) * Southern Africa (South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe) * East Africa (Tanzania, Kenya, and possibly Uganda and/or Rwanda) * South Asia (India, Sri Lanka, Nepal) * SEA (Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Indonesia) * Oceania (Australia, New Zealand) BAG: A brand new Osprey Nebula 32L in Cascade Blue/Coal Grey - this will be its inauguration so I‚Äôm really hoping that I‚Äôve selected well! I‚Äôve switched to a more structured backpack mostly due to a lot more rugged conditions planned for this go-round and a higher likelihood of lengthy travel legs where the comfort of carrying a \~15kg load becomes more important. I‚Äôve also switched to an REI packable 16L backpack rather than a one-shoulder tote for the same reason.

"Are We the Baddies? An MBA‚Äôs Crisis of Conscience So, you‚Äôve made it to r/mba. Congrats! You‚Äôre either part of, or want to join, an elite group destined to disrupt industries, optimize synergies, and leverage paradigms. But let‚Äôs have a quick chat, shall we? A little ""Are We the Baddies?"" moment for us MBAs. # Management Consulting: The Sharpest Tool in the Corporate Sociopath‚Äôs Toolkit You wanted to be a consultant. Who wouldn‚Äôt? Jet-setting around the world, charging $500 an hour to tell someone they need to ‚Äúright-size‚Äù their workforce (which is just a fancy way of saying, ""fire a lot of people""). But then there‚Äôs the *other* side of consulting. Like McKinsey, that time they decided to help Purdue Pharma flood the market with opioids. Or when they propped up dictators like a well-paid Instagram influencer. Who knew that ‚Äúdriving growth‚Äù and ‚Äúoptimizing value‚Äù could sometimes involve a body count? If you ever feel a chill while putting together a deck, it might just be the ghosts of ethical compromises past whispering, ""Are we the baddies?"" # Investment Banking: Making the World Go Round... Until It Doesn‚Äôt Investment banking, the dream job for those who find excitement in turning numbers into money, and money into... well, more money. Remember the 2008 financial crisis? Oh, you weren't there? Well, neither were most of us, but we‚Äôre all still paying for it. Literally. That ‚Äúfinancial innovation‚Äù (read: mortgage-backed securities) left a few trillion dollars missing, like your socks after doing laundry in a shared apartment building. Oh, and don't forget the Savings and Loan Crisis of the '80s and '90s. It‚Äôs almost like the words ""banking"" and ""crisis"" go together like MBAs and Patagonia vests. # BigTech: Don‚Äôt Be Evil...ish Tech was supposed to save us, right? But then, we got Meta. And Amazon. And Google. And Apple. And Twitter. And TikTok. And all those lovely privacy invasions, misinformation campaigns, and worker exploitation. Remember when Google‚Äôs motto was ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be evil‚Äù? Good times. Now it‚Äôs more like, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be evil... unless it‚Äôs profitable.‚Äù Or how about those nifty algorithms that decide what you see and think? They're just helping, right? Helping to destabilize democracies, encourage extremism, and maybe sell you a new toothbrush. You‚Äôve got to admire the efficiency. # CPG Brand Management: Selling You the American Dream (and Diabetes) Brand management is where the real magic happens. You take a product like sugary cereal, slap a cartoon character on it, and suddenly kids are hooked for life. And by ‚Äúhooked,‚Äù I mean ‚Äúdeveloping type 2 diabetes before they hit high school.‚Äù It‚Äôs all about creating lifelong customers, right? So what if their lifespan might be a little shorter? And let‚Äôs not forget the ‚Äúgreenwashing‚Äù efforts. Slapping ‚Äúeco-friendly‚Äù on a product that‚Äôs wrapped in more plastic than a Marvel action figure isn‚Äôt fooling anyone... except, you know, consumers. # PE/VC/HF: Private Equity, Venture Capital, Hedge Funds‚ÄîIt‚Äôs All About ‚ÄúEfficiency‚Äù Ah, Private Equity. Buy a company, strip it for parts, load it up with debt, and watch it collapse like a Jenga tower with a few pieces missing. But hey, at least you get to walk away with a nice little bonus. Venture Capital? More like ‚ÄúVulture Capital.‚Äù The odds of your portfolio startups succeeding are about the same as getting struck by lightning while holding a winning lottery ticket. But when one hits, you‚Äôre a genius! For the rest? Well, there‚Äôs always another entrepreneur willing to pivot their way into your checkbook. Hedge Funds? Just good old-fashioned gambling, but with other people‚Äôs money. ‚ÄúHeads I win, tails you lose‚Äù should be on the business card. # So... Are We the Baddies? Now, before you pull out that Patagonia vest and head to your ethics class (yes, they still make you take one), it‚Äôs worth asking: are we really the good guys? Sure, we‚Äôve got the spreadsheets, the frameworks, the KPIs, and the slick PowerPoints. But at what cost? Maybe it‚Äôs",Explorer,Patagonia,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/1etyj0z/are_we_the_baddies_an_mbas_crisis_of_conscience/
"Quality BIFL women's/unisex brands thread? The threads I'm finding are a bit older, so I'd love to get a thread of all brands that are BIFL for women's shoes, clothes, outerwear, etc. I've found that even some brands that are BIFL for men don't last nearly as long in the women's versions (I'm guessing the increased stretch in women's clothing is one factor, and that women's clothing tends to be thinner.) And while I tend to dress like a 12 year old boy most of the time, sometimes I like having clothing that is better fitted and designed for my body, so I like to get women's specific clothing. *NOTE: I'm not vetting these brands any further, just listing the suggestions given.

"Sh*t Meghan says I was going to post about something moronic that Meghan had said in her faux homemade promo clip. But then I thought: it wouldn‚Äôt be too much trouble to transcribe the whole horror story (it wasn‚Äôt) and see what holes there are. *Cat‚Äôs out of the bag. I‚Äôm shocked that we‚Äôve kept this a secret for so long.* *In 2 weeks my show‚Äôs coming out, which I‚Äôm so excited for. And also my business, which I think there‚Äôs been a lot of curiosity about.* \[Fake laughter.\] *Last year, I‚Äôd thought: You know what? American Riviera - sounds like such a great name, it‚Äôs my neighbourhood, it‚Äôs a nickname for Santa Barbara. But it limited me to things that were just manufactured and grown in this area.* *Then Netflix came on, not just as my partner in the show but as my partner in my business. It was huge. I thought about it, and I‚Äôve been waiting for a moment to share a name that I‚Äôd secured in 2022, and this is the moment. And it‚Äôs called As Ever. As Ever essentially means ‚Äòas it‚Äôs always been‚Äô, and if you‚Äôve followed me since 2014, with the Tig, you know I‚Äôve always loved cooking and crafting and gardening. This is what I do, and I haven‚Äôt been able to share it with you the same way for the past few years, but now I can.* *So as things are starting to trickle out there, I wanted you to hear it from me first. Of course there‚Äôll be fruit preserves - I think we‚Äôre all clear at this point that jam is my jam. But there‚Äôs so many more products that I just love that I use in my home, and now it‚Äôs time to share it with you. So I can‚Äôt wait for you to see it. Thanks, guys.* \[NB Read above with exaggerated inflexion, breathiness, tones of awe and wonderment, faux coyness.\] 1. **Quoth the maven, ‚ÄòARO no more.‚Äô** How long has Meghan kept What Ever, I mean As Ever, a secret? Let‚Äôs look at a rough timeline: \- 14 March 2024: ARO had a soft launch (never had, and never will know, a proper launch now), followed by a couple of uninteresting Instagram posts. From memory these coincided with Royal Family news. \- Summer 2024: Meghan files a trademark application (seriously?). \- August 2024: Application rejected due to many, many problems (from memory, all set out in a 37-page report). Given 3 months to rectify. \- November 2024: Meghan asks for an extension of 3 months. This is still live. Below is a photo of Meghan taken in October 2024, when ARO was going tits up. https://preview.redd.it/upazgaww2zje1.jpg?width=829&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92f9af66e77d843073dda8d2f0b34dcede37792c In between there are stories of challenges to the trademark, and difficulties in finding a CEO. When, during this timeline, did Meghan realise that ‚ÄôAmerican Riviera Orchard‚Äô would limit her to produce made on the American Riviera (TM) - which is Santa Barbara? And when she realised this, did she travel back in time to 2022 to register What Ever? And if she did this - why? 2. **TIL.** Brands named after places *must* be manufactured in those places. So Club Monaco clothing‚Äôs made in Monaco; Patagonia gear is manufactured in Patagonia: Donna Karan New York‚Äòs produced in New York; Banana Republic‚Äôs made in, um, a banana republic; The North Face winter clothing‚Äôs manufactured around Mount Everest. I mean, that‚Äôs why American Riviera Orchard was renamed the more geographically ambiguous As Ever. 3. **The real reason for marrying a prince of the realm.** Seemingly, to get her Tig blog made into a television series. Seems like overkill, but it worked! So basically she‚Äôs going to be shilling products, either (cough) made by her (what‚Äôs the obsession with jam?), or which she‚Äôs paid to promote. I‚Äôm no marketing person, but I think she married more money than she‚Äôll ever make. 4. **A mother and her 2 children.** The new logo of What Ever, irresistibly reminds one of the Papa and Mama palm trees at Olive Garden Montecito - except that Papa‚Äôs missing. But there are 2 birds, maybe representing 2 children. https://preview.redd.it/b3mcwc6i4zje1.png?width=120&amp;format=",Explorer,Patagonia,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaintMeghanMarkle/comments/1isoyfx/sht_meghan_says/
"""It's Time to Cancel Fleece"" ""**It's Time to Cancel Fleece**"" &gt;""*We can do better for the environment.*"" This is an article from [Backpacker Magazine](https://www.backpacker.com/stories/its-time-to-cancel-fleece) that touches on why I am trying to phase out fleece as much as possible from my own gear- microplastics. Not sure if everyone's already seen it, but thought it's worth sharing. (Personally I've noticed these unidentifiable little fibers that seem to be the bane of using communal or commercial washers/dryers. They adhere to everything but especially towels and end up as dust on bathroom countertops. I don't know what they're from, but regardless it really drives home to me how much microplastics that fleece clothing articles may be shedding into the environment.) &gt;Fleece probably saved my life. I had just dumped my canoe in light rapids on a cool and overcast summer morning in northern Maine. I caught the throw bag, got hauled out, and started shivering despite the adrenaline from my first-ever whitewater swim. And then I did as I was told: I removed my sodden Patagonia, windmilled it over my head until it was dry enough to hold warmth, and put it back on. As we all know, synthetic fleece, even when wet, is a good insulator. &gt;There‚Äôs a lot to love about fleece. It‚Äôs cozy, more affordable than other insulating layers, performs consistently, and it‚Äôs hard to destroy. I own several fleeces, as does just about everyone I know. And I feel a sense of guilt for what it‚Äôs doing to our planet. &gt;Fleece‚Äîeven the recycled stuff‚Äîis bad for the environment because it sheds. Every time you wash yours, millions of microscopic plastic particles swish off it and out your washer‚Äôs drain hose. According to a study conducted by Patagonia and the University of California Santa Barbara in 2016, your average fleece sheds about 1.7 grams of microplastic per wash cycle (recycled fleece sheds a bit less per cycle). Older fleece sheds more than newer fleece; generic more than name brand. &gt;To put that into context, in 2019, 7.8 million fleeces were sold, according to The NPD Group which tracks point-of-sale transactions across the outdoor industry. If every fleece sold last year was washed just once, that would equate to 15 tons of microplastics introduced into our air and water. According to another 2016 study from researchers in Scotland, American waste water treatment plants can catch more than 98 percent of microplastics, but even with such a high catchment rate, each plant still pumps out some 65 million microplastic fragments daily. &gt;Microplastic has proliferated far and wide in the 70 years since the bonanza began. It‚Äôs now in our tap water, milk, beer, you name it. According to a 2019 study by the World Wildlife Foundation, the average person ingests 9 ounces of plastic per year‚Äîthat‚Äôs 5 grams, or the equivalent of one credit card, per week entering into our digestive tracts, lungs, and bloodstream. No one yet knows exactly what harm this causes, but there‚Äôs a reason we don‚Äôt shred up our shopping bags and mix them with our salads. &gt;This is nothing new‚Äîthat Patagonia/UC Santa Barbara study has been out for years‚Äîand yet very little has happened to mitigate the problem. And so it‚Äôs time for consumers for put pressure on the gear manufacturers to start using more eco-friendly materials. &gt;True, Patagonia has worked to reduce the amount of microplastic that slough off its fleeces in the washing machine. And last year, Polartec released Power Air, a knit fleece that sheds 5 times less microplastic than a standard fleece. But there is no such thing as a fleece that doesn‚Äôt shed little bits of plastic in the wash. It‚Äôs easy to congratulate ourselves when 20 recycled soda bottles went into making our insulating garments, but 20 single objects are significantly easier to scoop up out of the waste stream than microscopic plastic fragments. &gt;So what do you do with all that fleece you already own? Hang onto it. Wear it until",Explorer,Patagonia,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultralight/comments/i19ozo/its_time_to_cancel_fleece/

"Beyond the Basic Bastard: Workwear and Americana # Beyond the Basic Bastard: Workwear and Americana This is the first thread in a series of threads about building your wardrobe in a specific direction after you have become content with [The Basic Bastard Wardrobe](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/5da1dc/the_basic_bastard_basic_wardrobe_and_inspiration/). For the first iteration, we‚Äôre going to be going over one of /r/malefashionadvice‚Äôs original loves: [workwear](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/search?q=workwear%20inspiration&amp;restrict_sr=1). MFA and workwear have had a long and storied relationship, but in recent years it has taken a backseat to things like SLP. Despite that, workwear is still a somewhat popular look that is easily accessible and easy to start wearing when you are coming from the Basic Bastard. This thread is *not* meant to be a comprehensive informational guide on the roots of the Americana &amp; Workwear aesthetic. While that is an interesting topic, and is something I am interested in researching further, this is mainly meant to be an introductory wardrobe expansion guide for those that are new to fashion. ## Characteristics I should start by specifying that there is arguably a difference between Americana and workwear. Americana is a style inspired by heritage American clothing, while workwear is a style of clothing that draws from clothing worn by manual laborers. So while a greaser look might not perfectly fit into the aesthetic of workwear, and a french work jacket is not technically Americana, the aesthetics share so many similarities that making two separate guides would be difficult and unnecessary. From here on out, I will be calling the combination of the two aesthetics ‚Äúworkwear,‚Äù even though it would be more technically correct to include both each time. Traditionally, workwear has tough materials and roomier cuts. It is commonly associated with fabrics like denim, flannel, and canvas. Common footwear choices include leather boots and shoes. Common features of garments include tough materials, multiple pockets, and utilitarian roots. These garments were originally created for or chosen because of a combination of durability, utility, and price. A long time has passed since then, though, and fashion brands have drawn inspiration from and appropriated these looks for decades. Aside from manual laborers, plenty of garments have been taken from various militaries and incorporated into everyday fashion. Examples include [M43 jackets](https://www.norsestore.com/shared/91/69/orslow-us-army-jacket_u.jpg) and [breton shirts](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/55/c7/ec/55c7ecfe140bd96174bf7a984ef77a48.jpg), among many many others. Ideally, the modern versions of these clothes are made in their country of origin or another first\-world country, and their durability should be on par with the originals. ## Buying ### Common Items **Jeans:** The most common and ubiquitous of any article of clothing under the workwear umbrella. You know what they are. Made of denim and usually blue, these pants eventually break\-in and fit the wearer‚Äôs body like a glove. They can be worn with any casual outfit and you don‚Äôt have to feel bad about wearing them in the yard or spilling sauce on them. You probably already have these, but if you find yourself wanting another pair, consider trying a more roomy cut like the [Levi‚Äôs 501](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bi-ZWQkH0p7/) or [Unbranded 601](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0202/3942/products/UB601_FR_2400x.jpg?v=1496351476).

"PSA: 100% machine washable merino wool clothing is often coated in plastic polymer to make it shrinkproof ""So‚Ä¶ Yes, your merino baselayer may be wool in a marketing sense, but chances are it has undergone a process to make it less itchy and resistant to felting. The process is called superwash. Wool has scales and those scales have the uncanny ability to stick to each other when agitated and wet. To remedy this ‚Äúproblem‚Äù textile scientists came up with a process that burns the scales off with chlorine so a coating can be applied. Officially dubbed Hercosett-125, the polymer based resin is added to chlorine treated wool fibres. This essentially makes the wool act like a synthetic (for a while). The polymer eventually degrades (micro-fibre pollution) and you are left with a weak garment prone to tearing. The whole process is also very energy intensive, chemical laden, and not environmentally friendly. "" Link: [https://medium.com/@austinhoefs/when-wool-is-no-longer-wool-9925f2c7fcfe](https://medium.com/@austinhoefs/when-wool-is-no-longer-wool-9925f2c7fcfe) For those wondering what alternatives there are, patagonia does use a different process that does not use chlorine or plastic. Another good option is alpaca. Not many companies use it yet, but appalachian gear company has some cool ideas. **Update 11/22/2021:** Companies that don't use superwash: * Wool Clothing; * [Patagonia](https://eu.patagonia.com/nl/fr/story-20285.html) \- doesn't actually sell a lot of 100% wool clothing though * Plenty of companies sell unprocessed wool sweaters, but I was more interested in lighter weight base layer type clothes * [Eileen Fisher](https://www.eileenfisher.com/were-working-on-it-chlorine-free-wool?country=US&amp;currency=USD) * [Dillings](https://uk.dilling.com/blog/Treated-vs-Untreated-wool/) * Alpaca Clothing * [Appalachian Gear Company](https://appalachiangearcompany.com/) * [Industry of All Nations](https://industryofallnations.com/) * [Arms of Andes](https://armsofandes.com/) * [Alicia Adams](https://www.aliciaadamsalpaca.com/) * [Peruvian Connection](https://www.peruvianconnection.com) * [Invisible World](https://invisibleworld.com/) **Emailing Campaign Reports:** * Icebreaker \[Superwash\]: ""I certainly understand your concerns and I would love to answer your question, however, I was unable to find the exact superwash process.

"Bike for long-term Bikepacking? (Months-Years). Hi everyone. Long story, short. Due to some tragic circumstances in my life, I (27yo) have decided to cycle around the world for a while. Not now, but maybe next year. I'm still working and saving. I have never done Bikepacking or Touring, but I have done lots and lots of km on roads, forest and singletracks. I've done several days or weeks hiking, camped in the wilderness many times. I've also gone backpacking. I know some will say that I should start slow, and see if I like this kind of life. And it's true, I will also start doing multi-day bike trips! But I also know that I love biking in nature, spending time outdoors, and camping. And truth be told I want/need to disappear for a while. So, I don't currently own any bikes, but I'm looking for one. Thats also why I'm writing this post! For some advice. I'm looking for a bike that can handle big loads, rough terrain, stuff like that. I'm planning on cycling maybe Germany (I live here) to Japan, and from there Alaska to Patagonia (my family lives in Chile), or I don't know yet, but so you have an idea of what kind of cycling I want to do. I have some knowledge of bike mechanics and such, and am willing to learn more in the coming weeks-months. I have a few bikes or brands in mind, but I don't know much, that's why I'm asking. Kona Unit X Bombtrack Surly The budget (for the bike) would be something between 2-3k ‚Ç¨ max, something like that. I don't know if it's also a good option to buy a frame, and from there, start assembling the bike with different components. Anyway, that's pretty much the plan. Any advice is welcome. Many thanks in advance! ‚ù§Ô∏è Edit1: Thank you for all the answers‚ù§Ô∏è I'm at work now, I will be reading everything later! Edit2: Thank you for all the replies, I will now see and respond.

"Ten Years of BIFL: My wins and fails Hi Y'all, I joined this community a decade ago and thought I'd share my thoughts. Here are my wins and fails in the BIFL journey, summarized: &amp;#x200B; Wins: * Silverware: a bit scratched now, but I think any 18/10 or 18/8 stainless steel silverware will outlive me. * Corded drill: Dewalt, purchased in 2013. Cord is somewhat annoying, but there's no battery to fail and it never runs out of juice in the middle of a project. Newer batteries are better and easily replaceable, so this one is debatable now. 2013 was a different story! * Leatherman multi-tools: Looks identical to the day I was gifted it ten years ago. So long as you don't abuse it too badly, you'll be able to will it to your favorite kid. * Mechanical keyboard: Used this thing for11 years now, it still makes satisfying clickies just like the first day! * Fancy dress shirts from Brooks Brothers: I have 5 and I've worn them many, many, times. I think there's more risk of these becoming unfashionable than them actually getting worn out. I've heard BB has gone downhill, so I'd encourage you to do your research before committing to a brand. * Mountain bike: can be serviced, has survived five years of hard use. Keep up with maintenance and it'll last you longer than you want it to (because new bikes are so much better). * Big wool sweater: so cozy in winter, but I have to wear it with long sleeves cause the itch factor is insane. This thing shows almost no signs of wear and doesn't get smelly because it never touches my skin! Win-win. * Self-built desktop computer: I built it in summer 2012 for \~$1000 and I've only upgraded the graphics card once. I can't play AAA games on high settings anymore but I can't imagine a laptop lasting anywhere near as long. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Fails: * Anything made of synthetic fabric: You'll get 1-2 decades out of good stuff, 3 if you're lucky or don't use it much. Applies to tents, backpacks, shoes, snow pants, any other recreational gear made of synthetics. Fancier brands don't last any longer than mid-level ones in my experience. * Non-stick pans. They're a wear item. * Logitech mouse - got ten years out of it before it started drifting :( * Any daily use soft good or clothing. I think great stuff which is well maintained might make it to to 20 years, but things like underwear or socks just aren't BIFL. * Darn Tough Socks: These typically last me 3-7 years. I've started air drying them now in hopes of pushing this. * Exofficio Boxer Briefs: these last around 5 years for me before they stretch out too much. Still super impressive for a pair of underwear. * Patagonia R1: 12 years in and it's still my main midlayer for hiking + splitboarding, but it's stretched out quite a bit and it's got a few little holes. I think I could push it to 20 or perhaps 25 if I'm lucky but synthetic fabrics only last so long when actually used. * Gloves: I've destroyed so many pairs of these skiing and mountain biking that I gave up on fancy brands and now use discount stuff. They just exist in such a brutal environment that if you're actually using them they break down after 2-3 seasons. Kinco, Free the Powder, and REI garage sale finds are my go to. * Any 3 layer rain jacket or hard shell: Fails after \~3-8 years of recreational use. Maybe I can push to 8 with DWR retreatment and tenacious tape on wear spots, but these things just wear out and lose their waterproofness. 3 layer garments definitely last longer than 2.5, but they're not truly BIFL.",Explorer,Patagonia,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1b9xi3r/ten_years_of_bifl_my_wins_and_fails/
"My Premium Consignment Experience ($775 earned and counting) I recently sent a bunch of clothes to ThredUp using premium consignment and I wanted to share a little about my experience because reading here helped me SO much when I was prepping to send my first bag. If you just want the results / numbers, scroll to the bottom. If you want the whole story, read on: #####Why Do You Have So Many Extra Clothes? To get ahead of any questions: I have a bit of a clothing issue. I love clothes, and I also love having a variety of clothes for my three kids to express themselves with. I‚Äôve also held on to many things that no longer fit me or my kids or my lifestyle over the years. I have also always loved thrifting. I used to give stuff exclusively to donation centers when we were done with it, but I never felt great about it because I‚Äôm aware of things like the Goodwill bins and how much donated clothing never finds a new home and ends up sent abroad or trashed, etc... So I probably keep too much rather than donating in case someone in our house might wear it one day. I do still donate, but I donate selectively to organizations that give clothes away for free, and I only give very good condition items that are specifically on their wishlist. #####My Poshmark Experience My first attempt at a donation alternative was Poshmark. I started listing my old clothes and my kids clothes on there. I did make some money and pass along some gems to new homes, but after about a year I was over the bins of clothing sitting around waiting for buyers, and the intermittent need to go find something and ship it. I had (and still have) a ton of clothes to offload, but Poshmark was too slow for me. Some of these clothes are expensive brands, but typically acquired well below retail, so maximizing the money I earned from selling was less important to me than it might be to others. #####Enter ThredUp. I started shopping a lot more on ThredUp because it feels like thrifting but it is so much more accessible when time is limited. Absolutely love it. I wanted to send clothes in, but was overwhelmed and confused about how it worked. Then I found r/thredup! I decided to go the premium route because of what I read here. I wanted the return assurance, higher acceptance rate, and to avoid horror stories of high-end items being rejected and ‚Äúresponsibly recycled.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt realize until I used premium consignment that the longer listing window is HUGE. A lot of stuff sold for me after it would have expired for the regular consignment. This is one of my main reasons now for preferring premium. #####Bags vs. Boxes I ordered a bag, sent it in, and liked what they accepted and the estimated payout. So, I ordered five more premium bags. The additional bags took WEEKS to come. Maybe months? I got impatient and ordered a label, printed it, and sent in a box of clothes. I could fit SO much more in the box! Given the $35 fee is the same either way, I now will only send in boxes. I used the five bags when they finally came because I didn‚Äôt want to waste them, but never again. #####Payout Eligible Brands / What to Send: I searched items to make sure they were accepted brands before I sent them. I still made some mistakes because there are brands with near identical names but one is accepted and the other isn‚Äôt. I sent in a couple nicer items that aren‚Äôt on the accepted brands list. One (a Merona trench) sold for enough that I was paid a few dollars, but the rest did not and I wouldn‚Äôt do this again. If it is going to take up space in the box, I want it to be eligible for payout. Also, they only ever accepted two or three pairs of jeans at a time from me, so I will never send more than two pairs in a box from now on.

Talented, carefree, rule-breaking, pioneering, sexy, and so casually stylish. Maybe my interest was planted by a trip I took to Yosemite with my family as a kid. Or the fact that my dad and I both loved reading mountaineering survival books.

They had the white collar, the rubber buttons, and were thicker and heavier than standard polo shirts. I likely even had one or two of them at some point growing up. But they always seemed more like a preppy or Ivy thing, or perhaps vaguely British given the origins of rugby. So how did Patagonia, one of the most techy of outdoor brands, start out by selling rugby shirts???

"Here's my review for SoS Renowned author Dan Brown has once again returned to the literary battlefield, armed with a 688-page tome, The Secret of Secrets, and the unshakable belief that his readers still find noetic science convincing. Exhilaratingly erudite Professor Robert Langdon, a man of knowledge, Harris Tweed jackets, Tod loafers, Dale sweaters and Patagonia puffers reappears to solve some really difficult puzzles. By his side stands a brilliant female scientist who is about as much a scientist as a horoscope column is peer-reviewed. Dr. Katherine Solomon, purveyor of noetic science, speaks lines of dialogue so profoundly absurd that every time she opened her mouth, I had to physically restrain myself from hurling my Kindle 10th Generation, currently running firmware 5.18.1, across the room. The only thing that saved it was the fact that my Dell Pro Slim Plus desktop, armed with a mighty Intel Core i9 Ultra processor, was in the way, an innocent bystander that didn‚Äôt deserve to be collateral damage in Dan Brown‚Äôs war on science. Her brand of noetic science treats the mind like a cosmic radio broadcast, with humans as antennas tuned permanently to static, blocking most of the important signals. Every time she launched into another grand pronouncement about her revolutionary research, it sounded less like science and more like the keynote address by an Ouija board at the International Convention of Crystal Healing. The novel insists that her theories are poised to change the way we understand human thought. What they actually change is the reader‚Äôs tolerance for pseudoscience. By the time she finished one of her monologues, I half expected her to whip out crystals, tarot cards, and a chakra alignment chart to validate her _statistically significant_ data. The plot moves with the speed of a caffeinated rabbit yet manages to feel formulaic, like a will-they-won‚Äôt-they subplot dragged out long after everyone knows they will. Historical city? Check. Cryptic symbols? Check. Implausible escape that makes Mission Impossible look like a documentary? Double check. Attractive female lead who is there mostly to remind you that Dan Brown knows women exist? Triple check. The author probably has also discovered the secret art of literary filler. Thirty percent of this book is padding, serving the story as well as my H&amp;M Slim Fit Coup Etroite sweater and Hoka Clifton 10 sneakers serve the writing of this review. The result is a reading experience that feels less like a thriller and more like a treadmill - lots of motion, but you end up exactly where you started, only more exhausted. I would recommend this book only to readers who enjoy the masochistic pleasure of hate-reading, because this is the literary equivalent of Emily in Paris - Langdon in Prague. The only ‚ÄúSecret of Secrets‚Äù I wish Mr. Brown had unearthed was the one where an author learns to evolve instead of recycling the same plot on a fancier high-finish 120gsm Stora Enso paper.[1] 1.

"I am Alex Buisse, adventure and humanitarian photographer from France and original author of the reddit photoclass. AMA! Hi r/photography, I am Alex Buisse, I have been a full time photographer since 2011 and part-time redditor since even before that! I started out highly specialized in commercial adventure photography (alpine climbing, really), shooting for brands like Patagonia, Petzl and Mountain Hardwear. I then slowly expanded to other adventure sports and took a more documentarian/journalistic approach to many stories, helped by attending the famous Eddie Adams workshop in 2013. Then in 2016, I began branching out and shooting humanitarian projects for NGOs, mostly development and refugee projects. I am currently balancing the two in roughly equal proportions. One of the things I love the most about being a photographer is that it gives me an excuse to go on adventures and get to places I would otherwise never get access to. Highlights include climbing K2 (not to the summit, unfortunately), sailing around Cape Horn and between Scotland and the Lofoten, shooting portraits of Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, photographing the Rio Olympics, skiing to the North Pole and much more. I strongly believe in giving back and strengthening the photography community. This is why all the way back in 2010, I wrote the original reddit photoclass, which has since been run many, many times. It currently lives on on [r-photoclass.com](http://www.r-photoclass.com). It was a great project and I love how many people it has helped over the years. It has always been and will always remain free (and ad free). I have also more recently launched a free [mentorship project](https://www.alexbuisse.com/Mentorship/1).

"Matador Seg28 as a personal item via American Airlines - 10 days in San Francisco, Yosemite, and Napa Valley [Seg28 pictured in gear sizer.](https://i.imgur.com/s3qlP2L.jpeg) Note the picture is a little misleading - from this angle and the fact that the the backpack is leaning, it looks a little too wide, but but it was not. It fit within the personal item size requirements, and indeed fit fine under the seat. My ticket actually included a carry-on at no extra cost, so ostensibly I didn't NEED to fit as a personal item, except for the fact that on the outbound flight, the carry-on space available was running out and the airline started forcing people in economy to check their carry-ons, so I was thankful mine fit under the seat as a personal item. I carried: 2x pants (Both CRZ Yoga golf pants, Lululemon ABC pant clones, one charcoal one khaki) 1x shorts (generic swim shorts, dunno the brand, used for sleeping and in the pool) 5x shirts (one button-down - SIR7 brand on Amazon I have a bunch of these in different colors from Amazon, they absolutely do not wrinkle). Other shirts were Uniqlo and 32 Degrees tees, 2x short sleeve, 2; long. 5x underwear and pairs of socks 1x fleece (Patagonia Capilene Air, discontinued) 1x lightweight packable jacket (On Running Climate jacket) (Edit to note: even though it's 95 degrees in much of the US right now, San Fran still gets very chilly (some days highs in the 50s) and Yosemite got down into the upper 40s at night at elevation, so outerwear was necessary) Toiletry, medicine and sleep kit packed in a Travelon hanging organizer Laptop and charger (Thinkpad Carbon) Kindle Various electronics (chargers, earbuds, battery bank) Uniqlo sling bag packed into main bag I added 2x more shirts and a six pack of cushioned sole socks purchased on the trip (to relieve aching feet from walking so much), and a few small souvenirs. I was able to do laundry halfway through the trip. I also sink washed my khaki pants at one point after getting food grease on them. I rubbed hotel shower gel into the grease spots and scrubbed them with a washcloth, then agitated them by hand in the sink, squeezed them out as much as I could, and hung them up on the hotel balcony, and they were almost completely dry in the morning. I think the low humidity of Napa Valley helped with the drying a lot in this case, though, that might not have worked so well on the East Coast where I'm from. What I would do differently: if I did the same trip again: I would bring my Matador Freerain packable backpack instead of the sling, and shoes more suitable for hiking than the ones I wore, due to the hiking I did in Yosemite. I basically chose to dress more for the city/urban stuff (San Francisco and Napa) rather than Yosemite, but my shoes didn't have great tread on the mountain trails, and while carrying a sling while hiking did work (with 2 liters of water packed), it was annoying having it swing around on me while scrambling over rocks and stuff. I still do prefer a sling for city travel, but it wasn't great on the trail. Same story with my shoes (Kizik Madrid, black on black.) Again, perfect in the city, not so perfect during the hikes. I find it depends on the type of trail - I've hiked with the Kiziks here on the east coast and in Japan, where the trails are mostly dirt. But in Yosemite, most of the trails were sandy and there was a lot of exposed rock that was pretty smooth and slick, and I could have used more traction. Comfort-wise they were great; just could have used some more traction. I was concerned about looking too much like a hiker while dining in San Fran and wine tasting in Napa, but I shouldn't have been. I did not use the laptop during the trip, but I needed to bring it in case there was a work emergency. I need to stop bringing the Kindle, as I find I barely use it while traveling. I always think I'll read on the plane, but on the way out I just watched movies, and on the way back I was so dead tired that I slept during ",Explorer,Patagonia,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1mbsyrh/matador_seg28_as_a_personal_item_via_american/
"My Xiaomi Smart Band 10 Story I'm writing from Lima, the state capital Peru's in South America. I am well aware that the experiences with Xiaomi of the majority of Redditors in this Sub have been vastly different from mine, and mostly positive. Mostly because Consumer Laws in my country are dismal. In the past buying online, at Amazon, and Lands' End, twice, once each, I got not what I had purchased. And both times I was awarded a full refund. Do you think I will buy again from that seller at Amazon and Land' End? YOU BET I AM! Because they have given me the confidence that they put my satisfaction first and needed be I will get my money back. They have won a costumer for life. On August 1. 2025 I bought a Xiaomi Smart Band 10 at a small Xiaomi branded store in a Mall near my home, most likely a franchise or reseller owned and operated privately and neither owned nor operated directly by Xiaomi Global. The only reason I bought the Xiaomi Smart Band 10 was the step counter. But the Xiaomi Smart Band 10 that I bought had a defect and added thousands of steps while riding public transportation, on very ok streets, sitting, still. On the 7. I went to the store for a refund. They offered technical support and needed be a replacement. But I have lost confidence in the brand and want a refund. Things look like I won't be getting one. Apparently Xiaomi Global does not offer any kind of, let's name it, ""Xiaomi Total Global Satisfaction Warranty"", for all of its products or enforce a such warranty on its franchisers and resellers, as, I will give, very few brands do, for instance Patagonia, and can ""hide"" behind our local consumer laws. In me Xiaomi has now lost a costumer for life. Patagonia could do the same, as stated by local consumer laws, yet they do not, so it's possible, not any brand is bound not to treat their costumers better than stated by our dismal local consumer laws. Still, the world has become a little better because at least there are places like Reddit where I can at least vent my feelings and frustration and because of that, I thank you for reading. Yes I know. It's not Xiaomi Global doing it. It's the franchiser or reseller. But Xiaomi Global could enforce on its franchisers and resellers, a ""Xiaomi Way"", the right way to treat Xiaomi costumers.",Explorer,Patagonia,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Xiaomi/comments/1mt4es3/my_xiaomi_smart_band_10_story/
"How does your brand promise align with your customer‚Äôs actual experience? Turning Promises into Proof: Where Brand Meets Reality A brand promise is more than a catchy tagline‚Äîit‚Äôs a contract. When that promise aligns with a customer‚Äôs lived experience, trust compounds. When it doesn‚Äôt, credibility evaporates faster than you can issue an apology. In this post, we unpack how to evaluate and strengthen the bridge between what you say and what your customers actually feel. Why Brand Promise Matters More Than Ever Your brand promise is the emotional shorthand that tells customers what to expect from you. It‚Äôs the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind their decision to choose you over competitors. But customers don‚Äôt measure your promise by your intentions‚Äîthey measure it by their actual experience, moment by moment. A mid-sized SaaS company promised ‚Äúenterprise-grade security with startup speed.‚Äù Their marketing was impressive. Their demos sparkled. But their customer success team was chronically understaffed, leading to 72-hour response times on critical issues. Within eighteen months, their Net Promoter Score dropped 40 points. The promise wasn‚Äôt a lie‚Äîtheir product could deliver. But the experience told a different story. This gap between promise and experience creates cognitive dissonance. And in a world where customers can switch providers with a few clicks, that dissonance becomes churn. Measure the Gap: The Brand Alignment Score Most companies sense something‚Äôs off between what they promise and what they deliver, but few measure it systematically. Try this diagnostic: The Brand Alignment Score (0-100) Promise Clarity (0-25): Can your frontline team articulate your brand promise without looking it up? Language Consistency (0-25): Do customers use the same emotional language in reviews that you use in marketing? Friction Mapping (0-25): How many touchpoints actively contradict your promise? Recovery Response (0-25): When things go wrong, does your response reinforce or undermine your promise? Anything below 70 suggests a meaningful gap. Below 50? You‚Äôre likely hemorrhaging trust without realizing it. Here‚Äôs what most companies miss: research from the Corporate Executive Board shows that customers who experience promise-delivery alignment are 32% less likely to churn and spend 13% more on average than customers who perceive even minor misalignment. The trust dividend isn‚Äôt theoretical‚Äîit shows up in retention rates and wallet share. Audit the Alignment: Listen First Want to know if your brand promise holds up? Stop talking and start listening. Ask customers this question: ‚ÄúIf you had to describe your experience with us in three words, what would they be?‚Äù Then compare those words with your brand messaging. If customers say ‚Äúconfusing‚Äù and your website says ‚Äúsimple,‚Äù you‚Äôve found your problem. Also track: NPS scores with qualitative follow-up, social media sentiment patterns, and support ticket themes.

But unlike brands that slap ‚Äúsustainable‚Äù on marketing and call it a day, Patagonia built operations around this promise: They actively discourage overconsumption with ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Buy This Jacket‚Äù campaigns Their Worn Wear program repairs and resells used gear They publish their factory list and supply chain challenges openly They‚Äôve donated over $140 million to environmental causes Employees get paid time off for environmental activism When the brand faced criticism over factory conditions in 2011, their transparent response actually strengthened customer loyalty.

"User-Generated Content Examples: How brands are winning &amp; how you can too User generated content is basically any content that is created by the consumer, customer, or user of a product, service, or a business. It differs in the fact that it is not sponsored by the brand nor do the creators have any monetary gains to make from the content they have produced. And a lot of brands are now leveraging these user generated content pieces in their individual marketing efforts. This could be because UGC is known to be 20% more influential than any other type of media when it comes to driving Millennial‚Äôs purchasing decisions. In this blog we are going to quickly look at some leading brands that are using user generated content and winning the marketing game. And learn from their tactics to implement in our own initiatives and efforts. **Why UGC Matters: The Power of Customer-Generated Content** Did you know that content created by real people greatly sways purchasing choices across age groups? Over 79% of individuals are influenced by it and 93% find it extremely helpful! That is a massive number. And not one that must be ignored if you want to make use of the content your users and audience have created for you. But that is not all. User generated content isn‚Äôt just more trustworthy, it is a lot helpful for boosting SEO factors as well. Because UGC tends to unknowingly incorporate long tail keywords, specific facts and figures, and candid content that search engines like Google favour for being unbiased and human written content. With that being said we hope you are ready to dive into some great examples of user generated content across different brands. Let us check them out. **10 Best User-Generated Content Examples in Action** **A. Social Media UGC** * **GoPro** \- Their entire social media strategy revolves around featuring stunning videos and pictures taken by clients using their cameras. The ‚ÄúPhoto Of The Day‚Äù, along with other hashtag competitions, motivates clients to post GoPro content on social media. * **Apple‚Äôs ‚ÄúShot On iPhone‚Äù** \- Campaigns shot with the phone by regular iphone users are put on a billboard around the globe and on social media for everyone to see. Showcases the camera features available in their devices. * **Starbucks‚Äô ‚ÄúWhite Cup Contest‚Äù** \- Guests were allowed to personalize the plain white Starbucks cups and post pictures of them on social media. The winning design was turned into a limited edition reusable cup. * **Airbnb Instagram strategy** \- They have ever featured pictures taken by the hosts and the guests at actual Airbnb properties, which show real life rather than promotional materials to market the brand. * **Coca-Cola ‚ÄúShare a Coke‚Äù campaign** \- By customizing their bottles with names and asking people to post a picture whenever they come across a bottle with their name, Coca-Cola sparked millions of social media posts. * **Adobe #Adobe\_Perspective** \- The Software Company uses hashtag posts to show off art made using their products. They also feature the user generated content on the company‚Äôs page and social media. * **Lululemon #thesweatlife** \- The athletic apparel brand encourages customers to take pictures of themselves doing various activities while clad in Lululemon clothing and post them on social media. * **‚ÄúCrash the Super Bowl‚Äù by Doritos -** Super Bowl aired commercials made by fans, enabling them to win and have them aired. For quite a while do-it-yourself commercials were broadcast by Doritos, extending prize-winning opportunities in the form of fans turned superbowl winners. * **Hashtag AsSeenOnMe by ASOS.** Customers are entitled to post pictures showcasing their outfits, tagging the fashion retailer. The snapshots are displayed on their corporate website and social media platforms, providing them with a requisitioned feed of genuine buyers. * **Glossier**.

"5 Game-Changing Copywriting Frameworks That Actually Convert I've been testing modern copywriting frameworks and realized that this are what top marketers use to create campaigns that don't just sell, but they build movements. Traditional Frameworks Are Dead AIDA worked when people had 30-second attention spans. Now? Now audience wants authenticity, impact, and community. These frameworks reflect how people actually buy in 2025. These are the top frameworks I use frequently: --- **1. PASTOR 2.0 (The Movement Builder)** Turns your product into a social movement **The Prompt**: &gt; Using the 'PASTOR 2.0' framework, develop a campaign that identifies the systemic [problem] affecting [ideal customer persona], amplifies its broader implications for society, shares authentic brand stories and customer journeys, includes diverse testimonials and case studies, presents our [offer] as part of a larger movement for positive change, and invites community participation. **Real example**: Patagonia's ""Don't Buy This Jacket"" campaign. Turned environmental activism into $1B revenue. --- **2. Features-Advantages-Benefits-Impact (The Conscious Consumer)** Shows your audience they're buying change, not just a product **The Prompt**: &gt; Design a 'Features-Advantages-Benefits-Impact' campaign that showcases how the [features] of our [product/service] create [advantages] for [ideal customer persona], deliver personal [benefits], and contribute to positive environmental or social [impact]. Use interactive content formats and real-time personalization. **Why it works**: Gen Z and Millennials need to feel their purchases matter beyond themselves. --- **3: Awareness-Understanding-Connection-Action (The Educator)** Builds trust through education before asking for the sale **The Prompt**: &gt; Create an 'Awareness-Understanding-Connection-Action' campaign that introduces [ideal customer persona] to emerging challenges or opportunities, helps them understand the implications through educational content, creates emotional connection through shared values and community engagement, and motivates action toward sustainable solutions using our [product/service]. **Hot take**: This is how HubSpot became a $30B company. They educated before they sold. --- **4. Hero-Journey-Transformation (The Story Seller)** Makes your customer the hero, not your brand **The Prompt**: &gt; Develop a 'Hero-Journey-Transformation' campaign using transmedia storytelling to position a relatable character facing similar challenges as [ideal customer persona]. Chronicle their journey of discovery and growth, showing authentic transformation achieved through community support and our [product/service], emphasizing genuine outcomes over perfection. **Secret sauce**: Show the struggle, not just the success. Vulnerability converts better than perfection. --- **5. Vision-Promise-Evidence-Momentum (The Trust Builder)** Creates FOMO through social proof and community engagement **The Prompt**: &gt; Using the 'Vision-Promise-Evidence-Momentum' framework, paint an inspiring picture of positive change that resonates with [ideal customer persona]'s values. Make authentic promises about impact and outcomes, provide transparent evidence through real-time data and verified testimonials, and create momentum through community challenges and gamified experiences. **Pro tip**: The ""momentum"" part is crucial. Static testimonials are dead. Dynamic, real-time social proof is everything. --- **How I Use These** 1. **Pick ONE framework** per campaign (don't mix) 2. **Fill in the blanks** with your specific details 3. **Test with small audiences** first 4. **Scale what works**, kill what doesn't 5. **Measure beyond conversions** (engagement, sharing, brand sentiment) **Want more free frameworks** Visit, [copywriting frameworks](https://tools.eq4c.com/) for 20 free frameworks with prompts.",Explorer,Patagonia,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/1njawra/5_gamechanging_copywriting_frameworks_that/
"Starting a new series called Outdoor Origins! Once a week I‚Äôll share a bit about an outdoor brand or product, where it came from, how it started, and why it ended up becoming part of adventure culture. Hope this helps to know and share more cool brands and handy products to help us in our adventures! The first one is **Patagonia**. 1. How it started So from what I found, back in the 1950s Yvon Chouinard actually taught himself blacksmithing just so he could make climbing gear for himself and his friends. His pitons were handmade in a little shop and turned out to be way better than what was around at the time. Climbers really took to them, and it kind of changed the sport. 2. From tools to a brand Fast forward to 1973, he set up Patagonia. At first it was still pretty small, but it slowly grew from a side project into one of the biggest names in outdoor gear. 3. Repair, reuse, rethink One thing I didn‚Äôt know until recently is that Patagonia started this program called *Worn Wear*. The whole idea is to repair and reuse your gear instead of throwing it out and buying new. (I think that‚Äôs pretty cool, especially since they‚Äôve been pushing that idea for years, way before it was trendy!) 4. Why it matters today For me, the takeaway is that Patagonia isn‚Äôt just about jackets or fleeces. It‚Äôs about keeping gear (and the stories that come with it) alive for as long as possible. In a time when so much stuff feels disposable, that‚Äôs kind of refreshing. Do you wear anything Patagonia? What do you think about the brand?",Explorer,Patagonia,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/adventures/comments/1nr7n2v/starting_a_new_series_called_outdoor_origins/
"Patagonia Ranch Table Experience in Argentina Somewhere between the ragged teeth of the Andes and the wide-open Patagonian steppe, where wind howls like a gospel choir gone feral, there‚Äôs an old estancia outside Bariloche that understands the power of fire, meat, and hunger. A place where time slows, where the earth feels stitched together with horse tracks and cattle trails, and where eating isn‚Äôt just a necessity. It‚Äôs a ritual, a contact sport, a communion with the land. The centerpiece is lamb, suspended over smoldering wood embers, kissed by smoke and flame until the skin crackles like parchment and the meat falls away with indecent ease. Around it, bowls of mountain vegetables and garden herbs are transformed into bright salads, plates of tomatoes that taste like the sun itself, and chimichurri so alive with green fire it could double as jet fuel for the soul. This isn‚Äôt polite dining. It‚Äôs primal, wild, celebratory, the kind of meal that makes you remember what food is supposed to be before we drowned it in plastic and marketing. The estancia is more than just a dining table. It‚Äôs the start line for the kind of adventures that stain clothes with dirt and grins with adrenaline. Riding horseback across valleys carved by glaciers, trekking through jagged ridges where condors float overhead like prehistoric aircraft, kayaking along icy blue rivers that could freeze your bones yet warm your spirit. This is a playground for the reckless, the romantic, and the ones who still believe the world has corners left to explore. And yet, when the sun finally leans heavy against the horizon, all of that energy folds into something quieter. A long wooden table under the Patagonian sky, bottles of bold Malbec uncorked and passed hand to hand, the scent of woodsmoke and roasted lamb hanging thick in the air. The night becomes a symphony of laughter, clinking glasses, and stories that never make it to paper. Patagonia is not a place that tolerates half-measures, and the seasons shape its hospitality with brutal honesty. Summer is the crown jewel. The right time to throw yourself into every canyon, river, and mountain path, when the air is warm, the nights long, and the stars stretch across the sky like spilled salt. It‚Äôs the season when the estancia wakes up fully, alive with travelers chasing both adrenaline and the kind of food that only comes from land wrestled into generosity. There are meals that feed you, and there are meals that brand you with memory. At this table, in this wild corner of Argentina, the difference is roasted into every bite.

"Advertising Strategies &amp; Public Relations in 2025: A Modern Playbook The media and communications landscape has changed more in the past five years than in the previous few decades combined. The lines between [advertising and public relations](https://www.iimmdelhi.com/course/diploma-in-advertising-pr-and-marketing) (PR) have blurred, consumers expect authenticity at every touchpoint, and artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping how stories are created, delivered, and consumed. In 2025, organizations can no longer rely on traditional press releases or expensive TV spots alone. Instead, they must adopt an integrated approach where advertising strategies amplify PR efforts, and PR strengthens the credibility of advertising campaigns. Those who master this synergy gain not just visibility, but also long-term trust and loyalty from their audiences. This playbook explores the most relevant advertising and PR strategies for 2025, supported by current industry insights, data, and real-world examples. **The Blending of Advertising &amp; PR** Traditionally, advertising and PR were considered two distinct disciplines. Advertising was paid, controlled messaging, while PR focused on earned coverage and reputation management. Today, however, these boundaries are increasingly fluid. PR and marketing convergence is one of the clearest signs of this shift. Over 70% of PR professionals now consider marketing skills‚Äîlike SEO, content creation, and analytics‚Äîessential to their roles. PR is no longer just about media relations; it‚Äôs about driving measurable business outcomes. Unified campaigns also show how the disciplines complement each other. For instance, Nike integrates high-quality video ads with socially conscious messaging that PR teams amplify in the media. Ads build awareness, while PR coverage sparks conversations, turning campaigns into cultural movements. **AI-Driven Advertising &amp; PR** AI is perhaps the most disruptive force shaping communication strategies today. Its impact is visible at multiple levels. Generative AI is now widely used for ad creation. The Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) reports that 86% of advertisers are using AI to design video ads in 2025, and nearly 40% of all video ads will be AI-generated by 2026. This levels the playing field, allowing smaller businesses to compete with big brands. AI also enables predictive outreach, analyzing social media trends to forecast viral moments so PR teams can craft timely pitches. It personalizes messages at scale, creating culturally sensitive, multilingual, persona-driven ads. Yet, unmoderated use of AI has pitfalls. Automated press pitches, if irrelevant, can flood journalists‚Äô inboxes and damage credibility. The key is to combine AI efficiency with human oversight. **Programmatic &amp; Contextual Advertising** Automation is transforming ad placement and targeting. By 2024, 80% of global digital display advertising spend was executed through programmatic platforms, and this figure is projected to rise to 90% by 2026. Programmatic systems use algorithms to buy and place ads in real time, ensuring relevance and efficiency. Meanwhile, contextual advertising is becoming increasingly important as privacy laws tighten and third-party cookies disappear. Instead of tracking individuals, contextual systems evaluate the environment of a webpage and place ads that feel natural. For example, an eco-friendly brand advertising alongside sustainability articles feels both authentic and relevant. **Trust, Authenticity &amp; Storytelling** In 2025, the most powerful currency in communications is trust. Transparency has become non-negotiable. A 2024 Edelman Trust Barometer survey revealed that 63% of consumers buy or boycott brands based on perceived honesty. Authentic storytelling is equally vital.

"The importance of Just Going - a story I finished strapping the dry bags of heavy food to my fork mounted cargo cages, stood up, and tried lifting my bike. A pang of anxiety hit me as my mind raced along the long and unknown road ahead - picturing broken rims and blown tyres, snapped carbon, struggle and suffering and ultimately failure. My bike was surely too heavy. I stood with my partner Claire, in a driveway of an AirBnB in Puerto Varas, Chile ‚Äì our launching pad for an almost 1500km journey along the great Carretera Austral, the single road which navigates North-South through the southern Aysen District in Patagonian Chile. This was the first time we had fully loaded up our bicycles, ever. We had no overnight cycling trips under our belts. I cycled recreationally and Claire was more of a commuter. Hopefully she won‚Äôt mind me relaying this story, as I see it as a testament to her absolute grit ‚Äì during a 60km training ride three weeks prior (perhaps the second or third time she‚Äôd ever ridden that far), at 55km she folded and called her sister for a pick-up. We were green. We‚Äôd also flown our bicycles and all our gear 12 hours from Australia for this experiment, I felt sick and ridiculous. We jumped on the bikes and took them for a tentative spin around the block. I feel the frame flexing strangely under the weight, and the steering at low speed like having two wild dogs tied to the handlebars and I try to convince myself that this is going to be OK. With me being a bit of a gear nerd and with more of an interest in equipment ‚Äì I had spent months going down rabbit holes online trying to prepare for something I really knew nothing about. We felt confident with the aspect of camping and living outdoors through our experience with mountaineering and back country hiking ‚Äì but distributing that equipment on a bicycle was unknown territory for us. The internet is full of opinions and advertising, if you‚Äôre anything like me balancing getting the best product with practicality of what you actually need creates this endlessly spinning vortex of recommendations and brands. Panniers and racks or bike bags? Touring or mud tyres? Schwalbe, Ortlieb, Restap, Apidura. Weight vs Speed. Then came the problem that essentially all opinions online advised against using full carbon bikes for remote touring, and also using 1x cranksets was not ideal. Claire‚Äôs bike is both of these things. I was so stressed and convinced of this being a huge problem, we even started looking locally for alternative bikes for her, which thankfully we were unable to find anything suitable. In my stress and desperation I turned to an extreme and last resort option, I talked to real life human beings who had ridden thousands of kilometres on their bicycles ‚Äì and I got a profound piece of advice (well actually two pieces of profound advice from two different people). Just use what you‚Äôve got and go. Just go. The second bit of advice actually completely conflicts with the first bit, but I‚Äôm going to include it because it is the piece of advice that I considered and appreciated the most once we were on our adventure ‚Äì Put the easiest gearing available on your bike. You're only going to wish for more granny gears. I messaged the local bike shop tech thanking him profusely for that one, Patagonia is hilly. But I suppose in the end, it was simply a ‚Äònice to have‚Äô. We set off from Puerto Varas two days later with the agreement if we hated it after a week, we would return and probably hire a car for the trip. The rest is history as they say. As we continued south we completely fell in love with everything about this mode of travel. The simplicity, the suffering, the achievement, the exposure to people and the environment. I see so many questions on these subs which would be answered by just going and giving it a shot.

"Discover why Haakwear‚Äôs patented H-Stitch‚Ñ¢ beanie beats Carhartt, Nike, Under Armour, Patagonia, and more in comfort, durability, and all-day wear. Introduction In the vast landscape of winter headwear, where countless brands compete for dominance with promises of warmth, style, and durability, one small company from Cleveland, Ohio has quietly revolutionized an industry that seemed impossible to improve. Haakwear, with their patented H-Stitch‚Ñ¢ technology, has solved a problem so fundamental yet so overlooked that it took a founder with military experience and an intimate understanding of comfort under demanding conditions to recognize it: the traditional beanie‚Äôs fatal flaw lies not in its materials or construction quality, but in the very placement of its seams. This is the story of how a Cleveland-based manufacturer has potentially created the most comfortable beanie humanity has ever worn, and why major brands like Carhartt, Nike, Under Armour, The North Face, and Patagonia‚Äîdespite their decades of experience and billion-dollar research budgets‚Äîhave failed to address a problem that affects millions of people worldwide every winter. The implications of this innovation extend far beyond mere comfort. For construction workers wearing hard hats, motorcyclists donning helmets, skiers and snowboarders requiring head protection, aviators using headsets, and countless others who must wear headgear for extended periods, the H-Stitch‚Ñ¢ represents nothing less than a paradigm shift in how we think about the relationship between our heads and the gear that protects them. The Beanie ‚Äî More Than Just a Hat The humble beanie occupies a unique position in human civilization. Unlike other articles of clothing that serve primarily aesthetic or cultural purposes, the beanie is fundamentally utilitarian‚Äîa piece of survival gear that has transcended its practical origins to become a global symbol of comfort, style, and identity. From the frozen construction sites of northern Canada to the windswept peaks of the Himalayas, from the bustling streets of New York City in January to the ski slopes of the Swiss Alps, beanies serve as humanity‚Äôs first line of defense against the cold. Yet for all their ubiquity and importance, beanies have remained remarkably unchanged in their fundamental design for decades. The traditional construction method‚Äîwhich involves gathering fabric at the crown of the head and securing it with seams‚Äîcreates what industry insiders have long accepted as an inevitable compromise. This compromise manifests as a pressure point directly at the top of the skull, precisely where the human head is most sensitive to sustained pressure and exactly where helmets, hard hats, headphones, and other protective gear exert their greatest force. The consequences of this design flaw are far more significant than most people realize. Construction workers report headaches after long shifts wearing hard hats over traditional beanies [1]. Motorcyclists describe the discomfort of crown seams pressing into their scalp during extended rides [2]. Skiers and snowboarders frequently remove their beanies mid-slope due to pressure-induced pain [3]. Aviation professionals struggle with the interaction between headset equipment and beanie seams [4]. Even office workers wearing headphones over beanies in cold environments experience the familiar ache that comes from sustained pressure on the crown of the head. This problem is so pervasive that it has spawned an entire category of workarounds and compromises. Some people size up their helmets to accommodate the bulk of traditional beanies, potentially compromising safety. Others choose thinner, less warm options that provide inadequate protection from the cold. Many simply endure the discomfort, accepting it as an unavoidable aspect of winter gear. Safety experts have even begun recommending against wearing any headwear under protective equipment, leaving workers and athletes to choose between warmth and comf",Explorer,Patagonia,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/madeinusa/comments/1mpsf2e/discover_why_haakwears_patented_hstitch_beanie/
"Does storytelling improve brand trust? Yes ‚Äî **storytelling significantly improves brand trust**, and it's backed by both psychology and marketing data. Here‚Äôs why storytelling works so powerfully in building trust: # üîç 1. It Humanizes the Brand * Stories **put a face** to your brand. Instead of a cold logo or generic messaging, people see **real values, struggles, and intentions.** * Example: A solopreneur sharing how they turned their garage hobby into a thriving DIY class builds instant credibility. üß† **Why it works:** Humans are wired to connect with narratives, not bullet points. # üìå 2. Stories Create Emotional Bonds * Great stories **spark emotion**‚Äîjoy, empathy, inspiration, or even nostalgia. * Emotion is a shortcut to trust. If people **feel** something, they‚Äôre more likely to **believe** and **remember** your brand. üß† Brain science backs this: Emotionally charged stories increase oxytocin, which fosters bonding and trust. # ‚úÖ 3. It Makes Information Stick * Stories make complex ideas **easier to understand** and retain. * Instead of saying ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre eco-friendly,‚Äù a brand telling a story about **saving 1 million plastic bottles** builds a **vivid, memorable** impression. üß† Story = structure + memory hook. # üí¨ 4. Testimonials Are Stories, Too * Case studies, customer journeys, before-after stories = social proof + relatability. * These build trust because others' **lived experiences** feel more reliable than ads. # üì£ 5. Authenticity Beats Perfection * In 2025, consumers crave **real** over polished. When you share struggles, mistakes, or humble beginnings, people see honesty. * A story like: ‚ÄúI failed at launching my first DIY class. Here's what I changed‚Ä¶‚Äù builds far more trust than hypey promises. # üîÅ Real-World Brand Examples: |Brand|Story Angle|Result| |:-|:-|:-| |**Airbnb**|Hosts' personal stories|Built global community trust| |**Warby Parker**|Founders couldn't afford glasses|Positioned as affordable disruptors| |**Patagonia**|Environmental activism stories|Deep trust with eco-conscious buyers| # ‚úçÔ∏è Pro Tip for Small Brands: Even a short brand story on your About page or social post‚Äîwho you are, why you started, and how you help‚Äîcan convert strangers into believers.",Explorer,Patagonia,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/digimarketeronline/comments/1n16iit/does_storytelling_improve_brand_trust/
"Mea culpa I was planning to write a post trying to explain Ryanair to non-Europeans and claiming essentially two things: 1) That no one checks size and weight of your bag up until 35/40 litres. I have flown dozens (literally) of times in Europe over the last 10 years and the only company which ever checked one of my bags was Wizz air, while I was able to consistently embark with backpacks which are maybe not too big (I don't use 40l as a personal item), but definitely oversized and weirdly shaped, like my Gregory Zulu 30 hiking pack, which is very tall. (On the other hand, everyone is quite strict about the number of items, so often they ask passenger to put their +1 in the backpack, even if it is just a small purse or a sling). 2) That the space under the seat in front is not allocated equally on Ryanair Boeing 737s, but more like 30% for the window seat, 50% for the middle one and 20% for the aisle, so it might be worth getting a middle seat if one has a bigger than usual backpack. Other companies, especially those using Airbus A320 planes like Lufthansa, allocated space equally and the planes are, in general, more spacious and comfortable. The second point is true, but I was very, very wrong about the first one. The full story is that I travelled to Toulouse, in the south-west of France, for a weekend and I only took a single backpack with me, because it was just a weekend and it was the perfect occasion to test my brand new Patagonia mini MLC 30 which I bought on sale a couple of weeks ago. Both legs were with Ryanair, but, while the first one was uneventful, for the second one we were not only asked to depart from the international terminal, which meant that we had to pass a useless passport control, but also that they were checking the size of both the personal item and the carry on luggage. Again, this has not happened to me in many years, more than 5 for sure, and on countless of Ryanair flights, but I was pretty confident, also because my backpack was not overpacked, so I thought that I just needed to put my jumper and my down jacket on (I had taken them off because it was hot) and I would have no problem. Unfortunately, when I tried to slip it into the box, it was a little too big and one of the straps got stuck outside and prevented the backpoack from getting fully in. The lady at the counter could already smell the 60‚Ç¨ fee. After a moment of panic, I moved to the end of the queue, I put my rain shell on, I put my dopp kit inside the inner pocket (just in case), moved the water bottle to inside the pack (to avoid discussions) and passed to the duffle configuration and, lo and behold, I can confirm that a (not overpacked) Patagonia mini MLC 30 does fit in a Ryanair personal item sizer. Phew About the bag, it packs nice, but the straps are a little worse than I thought. There is quite some space between the mesh and the rest of the pack, so it might be worth packing it separately or keeping the mesh open in case of bigger items.

I usually do laundry on Sunday mornings, and as I was hanging up a row of identical Brooks Brothers ocbds, I started thinking about the question of brand loyalty. They're the only ocbds I wear, most of the jeans I wear regularly are LVC '47s, I have a dozen Ebbets caps and almost nothing else, I go to work and travel with one (or more) Filson bags, and from May through September I'm wearing a pair of Quoddy bluchers and Patagonia stand-up shorts 5 days out of 7. Part of that is the fit and quality, of course, but I'm not sure that's the whole story.

They looked like they had just come from a game, and by their body language, laughter, and the excited voices of some of them loudly discussing incidents from the match, it was clear that they had won. All of them were smiling, **celebrating their victory** as they ordered their coffee. As I sat there, watching this **group of strangers bond** over their **shared experience**, I couldn't help but feel a twinge of envy, even though I did not know anyone from them. But then it hit me, this was a classic example of the ""**in-group effect**"" in action. You see, as humans, we have a natural tendency to identify with and feel a **sense of belonging** to a certain group based on shared characteristics or experiences. And in this case, those matching kits, and the high 5s were the equivalent of a secret handshake, signaling that they were part of the same exclusive club.

"4 weeks in England, Spain, France Short story: I'm planning to one bag mid-May through mid-June. I'll be spending a week in Coventry, England, a week in Barcelona, and a week in Toulouse, France for work conferences. I get to add a week in the middle somewhere for fun and I think it will likely be a week of vacationing in Barcelona (I've bought the tickets to and from Europe but not the connections). I work in a field so casual that it's pretty standard to wear printed T-shirts to conferences and I'm not presenting, so I don't have to worry about blazers or hard pants. We usually get one afternoon off for sight-seeing/exploring the area during conferences. But the week of vacationing is a bit of a celebration, so I might want to go somewhere a little nice to eat (we're not talking fine dining because I'll be doing this alone). I've been researching a lot and I just can't figure out *specific pieces* that my wardrobe is missing. I know I need at least one more bottom and probably a few more tops, but I just can't figure out what it needs. Maybe a skirt? But I think I might be stuck thinking to narrowly (linen or wool, knee length, navy or gray) and thought I would open it up to see if anyone had any ideas. The first picture is what I'm planning on including in my travel capsule: navy linen pants, coral dress, gray merino shell, navy merino shell, gray cardigan, blue/purple shawl, polyester (but very quick drying) plaid button down+cami for the plane. I just realized that I forgot my long sleeved gray merino top. [Here's what's coming with me](https://preview.redd.it/dzf7ulqtcdve1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=388b554b771ec213589a8b123c91c1f67ff533d2) The second picture is a random collection of clothes that I already have and think might have potential that I can't figure out (green merino zip up sweater, purple polyester top, coral polyester top, purple/coral button down quick dry tops, gray dress, blue and coral cotton/poly blend tops, blue cotton dress, printed convertible skirt/dress, teal skirt, gray ponte pants). Also, I want to emphasize, this is just the everyday wear. I have a Patagonia nanopuff that I always pack, as well as a rain jacket, and I think I've figured out shoes, underwear, pajamas, etc. Still working on workout clothes. [Does anything here have potential to flesh out what I'm bringing?](https://preview.redd.it/gqkqtdx8ddve1.jpg?width=3776&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59e3d51b2f68244f092082fc85f85cdabc9ae6bc) Would the teal skirt work as the missing piece? Or that printed skirt/dress combo? Longer story: I know I *can* one-bag this because I did 10 days last summer (with 10 unique tops/dresses) in a 42 Allpa twice: once to Spain/Italy, once to Scotland/England (without laundry both times). On the first trip someone commented on my one-bagging and said ""you should check out one-bag reddit."" Obviously it's better here. It was through this sub-reddit that I learned about capsule wardrobes and understood a problem I've had with both life and travel: although my neutrals lend themselves well to navy/gray, my shoes (and travel pants) were all either brown or black. I realized that if I switch to navy and gray bottoms (and shoes), that my wardrobe would basically become a capsule wardrobe. However, I only bought two new bottoms: the gray ponte pants (second photo, bottom center) and the navy linen pants (first photo, definitely coming). I've been wearing the ponte pants at least twice a week since I got them. When I bought them, I intended on bringing them on this trip. But now I'm worried that they'll be too warm to wear in Barcelona/south of France in June. In the past I brought the button down tops and dresses. Either the navy/purple button down or the gray long sleeved merino (not pictured) has always been my plane top, but I need to change bottoms. Right now the linen pants are my top option, but I'd consider buying something or the ponte pants.

"A Harley-Davidson V2 1200 cc model 1926 motorcycle in Finland. Harley-Davidson‚Äôs vision statement and mission statement provide insight into the company‚Äôs strategies and business growth path. (Photo: Public Domain) Harley-Davidson‚Äôs mission statement and vision statement focus on developing the business, in terms of products and branding. As one of the biggest motorcycle manufacturers, the company aligns its mission and vision toward strengthening its industry position and connecting with customers. Based on the corporate mission and vision statements, Harley-Davidson‚Äôs strategies and goals emphasize enhancements in products and customer relations. Thus, the corporate vision and mission statements determine the company‚Äôs strategic direction in responding to business challenges in the global motorcycle market. Harley-Davidson‚Äôs business purpose, mission, and vision guide competitiveness and organizational development. Harley-Davidson‚Äôs mission statement reflects the historical focus of the business and its role in the biker community. On the other hand, the vision statement directs the company‚Äôs strategic development as a leader in the motorcycle industry. Thus, Harley-Davidson‚Äôs vision statement includes factors that can be used as metrics for assessing the business, while the company‚Äôs mission statement focuses on a philosophical perspective about the underlying purpose and goals of the business organization. Despite this disparity, both the mission statement and the vision statement direct strategic management attention to variables for ensuring business capabilities against competition, which is a major challenge determined in the Five Forces analysis of Harley-Davidson . The vision statement underscores the importance of innovation to keep the business growing despite competition. On the other hand, Harley-Davidson‚Äôs mission statement highlights the importance of branding and motorcycle design to ensure competitiveness in the international market where many strong competitors operate. Harley-Davidson‚Äôs Mission Statement Harley-Davidson‚Äôs mission statement is ‚Äú More than building machines, we stand for the timeless pursuit of adventure. Freedom for the soul. ‚Äù This corporate mission represents the business purpose regarding the product, its utility, and its benefit to the rider. The following are the main points of Harley-Davidson‚Äôs mission statement: Manufacturing operations Product development for market demand related to adventure Beneficial experience for riders In terms of ‚Äúbuilding machines,‚Äù the mission statement refers to manufacturing operations as a foundation of Harley-Davidson‚Äôs business. Considering the company‚Äôs current products, these operations focus on motorcycle design, production, and sales. The corporate mission also indicates the pursuit of adventure, which can be used to guide Harley-Davidson‚Äôs competitive strategy and growth strategies . For example, new product development can focus on motor vehicles that satisfy target customers‚Äô need for adventure. On the other hand, in terms of ‚Äúfreedom for the soul,‚Äù Harley-Davidson‚Äôs mission statement directs attention to experiential benefits for bikers. The company sees itself and its products as providers of that sense of freedom that customers experience in riding motorcycles. The applicability and practicality of this mission statement (and the vision statement) depend on external conditions, such as the economic, social, and technological factors enumerated in the PESTEL/PESTLE analysis of Harley-Davidson , which affect market response to the company and its products. For example, the relevance of the factors of adventure and experience depends on social trends influencing the transportation sector and people‚Äôs attitude toward using motorcycles for their regular mobility needs. As a result, these external factors influence strategic effectiveness and the achievement of business goals developed based on Harley-Davidson‚Äôs mission statement and its strategic ",Rebel,Harley-Davidson,google_cse,https://panmore.com/harley-davidson-vision-statement-mission-statement

"Few companies succeed in building brands that eventually become cultural icons in our society and achieve iconic status. A brand can be forgiven for lower product quality when compared to competitor products if their brand story and identity resonates with their target audience. ‚Äç ‚Äç One such brand is Harley Davidson. They have a pretty average bike. When you assess its performance compared to competitor bikes ‚Äî it‚Äôs not the fastest and it‚Äôs not the best. But it still has a loyal fan base and customers love the brand. Why? People had the same love for Coke. So when the brand introduced ‚ÄúNew Coke‚Äù, because it did not taste good compared to Pepsi, it wasn‚Äôt received well. The company reported back to the previous product. We‚Äôve made an article on this that you can check out here ‚Äî (provide link) ‚Äç The journey of Harley into becoming a cultural icon So why is Harley Davidson such an iconic brand? Why is it not just a bike but became a way of life, an attribute? ‚Äç ‚Äç Harley-Davidson Motor Company was formed in 1903 by four men, led by Robert Harley, who began their operations in a small shed in the Davidson family‚Äôs backyard. People who own their product love the brand and pride themselves on owning a Harley Davidson bike. In spite of having occasional technical problems like oil leakages, people love the brand for its personality. ‚Äç What‚Äôs the reason behind the love of the brand? Sonny Barger, who is the founder of the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club, writes in his book the reason people love Harley Davidson, ‚Äç ‚ÄúWhat it‚Äôs really about with a Harley Davidson is the sound‚Ä¶..everybody loves that rumble. Another thing Harley owners really crave about their bikes is the low-end torque, the raw power coming out of the gate. It runs out pretty quick once you get up past ninety miles an hour. Most Harley riders don‚Äôt care about high speed, they‚Äôd rather have that low-end torque, the one the gurgles down in your groin and gives you the feeling of power. The Japanese bikes, while they have the power, they don‚Äôt quite have the feeling of power‚Äù ‚Äç ‚Äç Harley Davidson is a rugged, strong, and powerful brand image. It‚Äôs clear the brand, through its marketing, gives you the feeling of being yourself, freedom to travel, living a life without rules. ‚Äç ‚Äç Because of the love of the brand, people not only buy their bikes but also tattoo their brand name on themselves. Capitalizing on this, the brand ventured into merchandise ‚Äî selling t-shirts, socks, cigarette lighters, and more. All of them were tailored towards the masculine and powerful nature of the brand. ‚Äç ‚Äç The brand made a major misstep by introducing Harley Davidson‚Äôs range of perfume and aftershave products. Their goal was more products equals more sales. That holds true for a while until the brand value and loyalty start declining. It ends up diluting the brand, resulting in the production of inferior products that tarnish the brand‚Äôs name in the future. In the 1990s, they continued to alienate their customers through products such as wine coolers, perfumes, infant clothes, ties, and so on. ‚Äç ‚Äç Charles E Brymer, CEO of Interbrand Group, said. ‚Äú Harley Davidson values are strong, masculine, very rugged values. For them to go into a sector that doesn‚Äôt live up to what those values would be disastrous‚Äù The brand since then realized their mistake and the effects of this misstep were a limited one. ‚Äç Lessons from Harley Davidson Never lose sight of your brand values: If your brand values are strong, rugged, and freedom-to-explore in nature, you shouldn‚Äôt be selling perfumes and kid‚Äôs clothes. That‚Äôs where Harley Davidson messed up. It went away from its values and slowly alienated its existing loyal fan base. ‚Äç ‚Äç A brand‚Äôs foundation is built on its values. Brands can evolve over time, but their values should not change. The primary driving force behind your brand, business, behaviors, and decisions are your core values; these uncompromising truths and principles define who you are. You are guided i",Rebel,Harley-Davidson,google_cse,https://www.poixel.com/publishes/the-reason-harley-davidson-has-an-iconic-brand-identity
"What comes to mind when you think of Harley Davidson? Big, tough, mean looking guys cruising on chromed up beasts of motorcycles, right? Now, what character traits come to mind when you think of a Harley bike? Masculine, all-american, rebellious and independent. This is the value of brand: the feelings and emotions evoked by a name, a logo, or even the thought of a company and their products. Brand value accumulates over time, building upon the experiences and contact customers have with the brand. In the case of Harley Davidson, brand equity has amassed to such a level that the brand is consistently ranked in the top 100 brands of the world. In 2013, the brand alone was worth $4 billion, placed as the 96th most valuable brand on the planet. In fact, the licensing of the Harley-Davidson brand and logo accounted for $40 million of the company's net revenue in 2010. The feelings associated with the brand have a powerful impact on the way customers live their lives, with many enthusiasts going to extremes like tattooing the corporate logo on their bodies. Through their association the branded motorcycles, fans channel the values and characteristics of Harley Davidson; they use the brand to express their identity‚Äö√Ñ√Æbut, this isn't really news is it. What's the big deal? ‚Äö√Ñ√ß The Harley brand is experienced and expressed through product design The very specific aesthetic and emotion conjured by the Harley Davidson brand is exactly why their announcement of the Project Livewire Experience caused such a ruckus. For their first electric motorcycle prototype, fans and media alike were up in arms: blinged-out heavy cruiser bikes are what Harley does. It goes against everything Harley had spent the last 110 years building and positioning the brand around. Where‚Äö√Ñ√¥s the classic Harley rumble and rebellion in an electric bike? How can they diverge so extremely from their storied legacy? In actuality, the EV (electric vehicle) is a very logical progression along Harley's trajectory for the brand since 2007. In fact, the heavy cruiser focused brand that the Livewire detractors know and love has only really been around since the early 80s. In response to the backlash against Project Livewire, Motorcycle USA published a well-researched piece on the brand history in terms of physical styles and sizes. Harley used to make every kind of motorcycle: from scooters to sportbikes, not just heavy cruisers. They also weren‚Äö√Ñ√¥t as ‚Äö√Ñ√≤all-American‚Äö√Ñ√¥ as their marketing may lead you to believe, since they owned an Italian and a Japanese sub-brand respectively, and even outsourced their manufacturing to Japan for a while. In 1981 however, a collection of Harley executives led by Vaughn Beals bought the brand from holding company AMF (American Machine Foundry) discontinuing most of the brand‚Äö√Ñ√¥s product lines, and radically re-invented the brand. These executives recognized the so-called ‚Äö√Ñ√≤Japanese Invasion‚Äö√Ñ√¥ of the motorcycle industry, especially in the lightweight class, so they set out to create a more competitive brand. The new and improved Harley focused on patriotic, American‚Äö√Ñ√Æbordering on xenophobic‚Äö√Ñ√Æmessaging of the type we all recognize today. Coupled with their new product line of highway cruiser bikes based on the new heavy duty Evolution motor, the brand was positioned to differentiate itself from the Japanese brands taking over the lightweight market. And the positioning worked‚Äö√Ñ¬∂ up until around 2008 when Harley ran into trouble once again. There were two factors at play which affected sales. The financial crisis in the banking sector was the first. No longer did people have access to easy credit to indulge in a $20,000 weekender bike or have the cash to fill up a large gas tank. Instead, budget conscious consumers needed a cheaper, fuel-efficient bike more practical for commuting. The Harley brand still represented independence, but high spending wasn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t something most Americans could afford anymore. Another challenge for was the demograp",Rebel,Harley-Davidson,google_cse,https://skyrocketdigital.com/article/harley-davidson-brand-deviation

Harley-Davidson also encouraged members to form local chapters linked to dealerships, utilizing community tactics for growth to allow for community expansion while maintaining a connection to the brand. 3. Engaging with Customers Harley-Davidson actively engaged with its community by involving employees at all levels. Executives and staff participated in rides and events, listening to customer feedback firsthand.

"How Harley-Davidson Saved $442 by Wasting Thousands, or: How To Lose A Customer Three years ago I purchased my first Harley-Davidson: A 2018 Heritage Classic 114. I wanted that deep, iconic V-twin rumble and I wanted to buy American. The fact that the bike is incredibly comfortable also played a significant role in my decision. A lot of people in the USA complain about job outsourcing and the lack of manufacturing in the country, and rightfully so. I try to put my money where my mouth is by supporting American brands - which is 50% of the reason I purchased a Harley-Davidson. In fact, I financed through them, joined Harley Owner's Group (HOG), and purchased all of my motorcycle insurance through Harley. I liked my Heritage Classic so much that, a couple years later, I decided to upgrade to a touring model - a 2022 Road Glide Limited. It was fantastic. I put 800 miles on it riding all over Southern California, including the Pacific Coast Highway. It was my second trip on the bike that proved to be disastrous. I was riding from Arizona to Texas, around 1,200 miles. Around 900 miles into the trip... my engine died. I was cruising 80mph (the posted speed limit) in the right lane of I-10 heading east. The motorcycle was fully stock and had just received its first oil change by Harley 800 miles ago. The motor abruptly dies while cruising on the highway and, of course, the motorcycle begins decelerating rapidly. I pull over to the side of the highway, in the middle of the Texan desert, to try and figure out what had gone wrong. After checking around the motor for signs or leaks, and attempting to restart the motorcycle to no avail, it was clear that the motorcycle was dead. Now I have a serious problem. Several of them, actually. I have a motorcycle that doesn't run, I'm 330 miles from my destination, it's 10:00 AM and mid-August in the hot Texan desert, and I need to be at work the next day. I called HOG membership services, Harley Owner's Group, and am quoted around $800 to tow my motorcycle to the nearest Harley dealer. I tell them to hold off on calling a tow company until I can speak to my motorcycle insurance roadside assistance. I call the number listed on my insurance card, and after going over the details I am told that they are sending a tow truck my way. I give my credit card information and they immediately charge me $442.50 for a 300 mile tow, which is reasonable. I am also told to wait for a text that will include the tow company's details and an ETA. I wait 30 minutes, receiving several texts stating ""we're still attempting to locate a suitable tow company"". I call back to find out that the first agent had gotten my cell number and email address wrong, and that their system showed my request as ""completed"". It was obviously not completed. So the second agent goes through all the details again, allegedly correcting the email and phone number, to then dispatch a tow truck. Another 30 minutes goes by and I still do not receive a confirmation text. So I call back again... same problems. This went on for hours - almost 5 hours, to be exact. If I had no asked to speak with a supervisor, who knows how long it would have taken, or if they ever would have bothered. I debated hitchhiking to the nearest town and renting something to tow the bike myself. Unfortunately, after calling every possible place and trying their websites, nothing was available or even open. I'm relatively new to Texas, and wasn't going to ask the one friend I have to drive 5-6 hours to pick my bike and me up. So my choices are now to wait for a tow truck or abandon the bike and figure out another way home. The tow truck did show up, however, at 3:30 PM and the motorcycle was loaded onto the flat bed by 4:00 PM. Then began the long, 300 mile drive to a Harley dealership that was relatively close to me (but it's still 1.5 hours away). Had the brand new motorcycle with ~1,700 miles on it not died, I'd have been home by 3:00 PM at the latest.

"My Dad died and we have to sell his motorcycle. Is the dealership going to screw us? 2017 Harley Davidson Softail Slim &lt; 1,000 miles My Mom bought this brand new for my Dad for ~$20,000 back in 2017 from a Harley Davidson dealership. My Dad used it for a little over 2 years before he was diagnosed with cancer. His health began declining and the bike sat unused in my parent's garage for ~4 years. He died last year, and my Mom decided to sell it. Because we dont know anything about motorcycles other than how to start one, my Mom reached out to the dealership she bought it from to ask if they would have a mechanic check to see if there was anything wrong with it (we know it starts, but it did sit unused for a long time). They agreed, and when my Mom brought it in, they said they might be interested in buying it back from her after their shop checks it out. So the bike stayed at the dealership for 13 weeks. My Mom called them a bunch of times to get the status of the bike and they kept giving her to run-around with vague excuses. I told her it was crazy to let them keep it that long, and that she needed to get it back ASAP. She called them told them she was just coming to get it, and all of a they said they want to meet with her tomorrow to discuss a price. To me, it seems they've been acting super sketchy. My Mom asked me to go with her, and I just wanted to have a good idea the value of the bike before going.",Rebel,Harley-Davidson,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/comments/1gf7auv/my_dad_died_and_we_have_to_sell_his_motorcycle_is/

"Sometimes I think the brand is a little embarrassing. My family has been closely tied to Harley Davidson for decades. As a kid, HD gear was half my closet, and posters and memorabilia lined our farm workshop. I think they look cool, and sound cool, and feel cool to ride. The business side has been a disaster as long as I can remember, but lately I'm feeling a little embarrassed by the brand. Im visiting the family in Wisconsin this week. My sister and I were out on some errands, and having recently received a pair of boots in the mail that were a size too big, I thought ""hey, might as well hit the dealership and see what they've got"". We walk in to Milwaukee Harley Davidson, and are immediately greeted by two teenagers in skimpy bikini tops who are offering us a bloody mary (in Wisconsin, serving booze is legal at 18). My sister immediately shot me a look that said ""is this the kind of shit your into?"" I know I've met old dudes at biker bars that would think that's a dream come true, but I'm in my mid-late 20's. We don't really roll that way, and it's hard to convince anyone you're not a creep if that's the kind of treatment the brand thinks you want. It doesn't help that the Milwaukee dealership *and* my home dealership in Boston are both immediately adjacent a strip club. The tough-guys-and-hot-girls aspect of the culture starts to seem pretty sleezy now that the average harley rider is 50+ years old. I could write a similar rant about the annoying treatment *inside* the dealership, but that's for a different thread.",Rebel,Harley-Davidson,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harley/comments/1mo0oaf/sometimes_i_think_the_brand_is_a_little/

"My ""Love/Hate"" relationship with the HD x440 I‚Äôve owned this bike since late June 2024, and I‚Äôve clocked around 9,500 km so far. My usual riding includes daily office commutes, lots of weekend rides, and most recently, a 2,400 km ride across South India with my friends. From the day I was gifted this bike, I thought I had made a decision I wouldn‚Äôt regret. But now I wonder‚Äîdid I put too much trust in the brand? Was it the feeling I got during the test ride that made up my mind too quickly? Either way, I rolled her out of the showroom in Kochi, excited for what was ahead. Now that I‚Äôve ridden this bike almost every single day, I think I‚Äôm qualified to talk about it‚Äînot as a fanboy, not as a hater, just as an owner who has lived with it. Hopefully, the title makes it clear that this isn‚Äôt a praise post or a rant. Just an honest take on the good and bad of owning the X440. The Good Well, let‚Äôs just say‚Äîthis bike evokes feelings. It‚Äôs not just a machine; it‚Äôs something that connects with you. At its core, it‚Äôs a simple long-stroke engine, the kind that should just do its job and let you enjoy the ride. But of course, we live in a time where simplicity isn‚Äôt enough. So, they had to slap on a bunch of electronics to make it feel ‚Äòpremium‚Äô‚Äîbecause why let a well-built engine speak for itself when you can have a screen tell you how premium your ride is? That aside, the grunt is real. The moment you twist the throttle, it pulls hard and clean, letting you squeeze through gaps in traffic without breaking a sweat. It has that low-end torque that makes city riding effortless, and on the highway, it just settles into a nice rhythm. It‚Äôs got that mechanical rawness that makes every ride feel engaging. You don‚Äôt just sit and ride‚Äîyou feel every pulse of the engine, every vibration through the bars, reminding you that you‚Äôre riding something with character. But where this bike truly shines is out on good roads. I‚Äôve taken it through Ooty, the winding gap roads of Munnar, and every moment was a blast. The sound of the exhaust echoing through the hills, the little whine of the single-cylinder 440 beneath me‚Äîit all came together in a way that made me fall in love with it. The moment you open it up, it just clicks‚Äîthe engine, the road, and you. No distractions, just pure, connected riding. It makes you forget about everything else, keeping you fully present in the moment. Every twist of the throttle, every downshift, every slight movement of your wrist‚Äîit all feels just right. The Bad Everything has its price, or is it karma? Since the day I got the X440, I‚Äôve been an active member of the owner community, seeing posts about issues‚Äîsome minor, some serious. At first, I assumed many of them were just due to lack of proper maintenance, especially from newer riders. I even helped out where I could, sharing what I‚Äôd learned from friends and my own automotive interest. But then, I started facing issues myself. Now, I genuinely do understand‚Äîit‚Äôs a machine, issues will happen. I also get that it‚Äôs a first-gen product, issues will happen. And for those who‚Äôd ask, ""Why didn‚Äôt you just get a Japanese bike if you wanted reliability?""‚Äîwell, I trusted modern engineering and believed we‚Äôd come a long way from the days when machines breaking down was just part of the ownership experience. Turns out, maybe I was too optimistic. It all started after the first service. A simple clutch spring broke mid-commute on my way back from the office. Now, I wasn‚Äôt expecting a critical mechanical failure just a few thousand kilometers into ownership, but hey, it‚Äôs a bike‚Äîthings happen, right? So there I was, crawling in 2nd gear (because the shifter had decided shifting wasn‚Äôt its job anymore) all the way to the service center. Funny part? The part took a full week to arrive, completely messing up my daily commute. And the follow-up? Absolutely terrible. I was frustrated, but again, ""New bike, things can happen,"" I told myself. So I let it slide. Then came the GOPD change‚Äîa ",Rebel,Harley-Davidson,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/indianbikes/comments/1j8yfeg/my_lovehate_relationship_with_the_hd_x440/
Buying a brand new Harley Davidson RG. How to get a good deal. Hey gang. In the next couple days I will be buying a brand new Harley Davidson Road Glide Special. As I have never bought anything brand new in my life I was hoping people could give me some tips on where and how I can save money and any of the gimmicks they might try and get me with. I‚Äôll have good credit and a lot of money down( approx 25-30% down). I have deposits in at two different dealerships.,Rebel,Harley-Davidson,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harley/comments/sbu0v2/buying_a_brand_new_harley_davidson_rg_how_to_get/
"Got called a slur while biking home from work Yesterday I was on my daily bike commute back home, for reference, I work at a university in the middle of a small city. My route home goes through some city streets before turning on to a bike lane for almost the entirety of the rest of the way. I was on this small city street section going in between some construction which had made it one lane at that point. During this section I can keep up with the cars (even on my normal non electric bike) with not much issue as they don‚Äôt go that fast through the stop lights and traffic and construction. But here I was, minding my own business keeping up with the car ahead of me right before my turn and this motorcycle guy on his big Harley Davidson (tm) is tailgating me pretty hard and clearly trying to bother me. I just ignore him and start my left turn onto my bike lane street and as I do, he screams out at me ‚Äúget the fuck out of the way ponytail faggot‚Äù. To me, I found it quite humorous and just kept going. I was wearing the most cis het outfit ever, my school branded polo, khaki pants, and my backpack and helmet. So the fact that he thinks to say that just because I have my hair in a ponytail? Quite amusing. I do have very pretty long hair, but I do try to keep it in a ponytail to avoid getting it in my face. I‚Äôd have to assume he was just annoyed that the streets are allowed to be used by bicycles and anything other than his Harley Davidson (tm) motorcycle. But that‚Äôs that, that‚Äôs my story of the day. How would you have handled it? Done anything differently? I feel lucky he didn‚Äôt try to clip my wheel with his motorcycle or get physical as he sounded very agitated.",Rebel,Harley-Davidson,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/bikecommuting/comments/1nlyduf/got_called_a_slur_while_biking_home_from_work/

"Q: Patagonia has a history of values-driven innovation. Where did that start? Yvon Chouinard started making climbing equipment in his parents‚Äô backyard when he was still a teenager. When he and his friends began pioneering big wall climbs in Yosemite in the ‚Äô60s, almost all climbing equipment was imported from Europe. Pitons, metal spikes that climbers used to establish protection, were made out of soft iron that could only be used once or twice. That was fine on shorter routes, but for long climbs like the ones at Yosemite, you would need to carry a huge supply. Yvon‚Äôs innovation was the hard steel piton that could be hammered in, then tapped out and reused time and time again. As climbing became more popular in the late ‚Äô60s, early ‚Äô70s, climbers gravitated to the established routes. Every time someone hammered a piton in, it widened the crack slightly. You had to use wider and wider pitons. Yvon and his business partner realized that the way that they were making their living was destroying the sport and desecrating the rock. There was an alternative. British climbers used aluminum chocks that could be placed and removed without damaging the rock. But American climbers were not familiar with them. And it would be a very expensive proposition for a tiny company to switch from making steel pitons to aluminum chocks. The company had a reputation for making the best pitons in the world. It had great market share. If it had just been, ‚ÄúWell, chocks are newer and more innovative,‚Äù I don‚Äôt think the company would have made the change. The moral dilemma was the reason for the change. They produced a catalog with a 14-page essay that was part user‚Äôs manual and part manifesto explaining why climbers should switch from pitons to chocks. It was reviewed in all the climbing magazines. It was discussed at the base of the climbs. It had an enormous impact. When the catalog went out in June ‚Äô72, 70% of the business was pitons. When I came to work in March ‚Äô73, nine months later, the business was 70% chocks. ‚ÄúIf you speak to your customers as a community, as friends and equals, and share something that you‚Äôve learned and a change that you‚Äôve made, you can be influential in helping others to change.‚Äù That was an indication of how if you speak to your customers as a community, as friends and equals, and share something that you‚Äôve learned and a change that you‚Äôve made, you can be influential in helping others to change. It was a useful lesson. Q: How has Patagonia‚Äôs approach to business evolved over time? Patagonia, the clothing company, was conceived as a way to support Chouinard Equipment, which was hugely labor-intensive and earned about 1% profit. Eventually, the climbing equipment company was sold to its employees and morphed into Black Diamond, which is still a very successful company. By the late ‚Äô80s, Patagonia was growing in a crazy way. Yvon was really worried, ‚ÄúAre we going to lose our soul? Will it continue to be a place that I want to come to work for every day?‚Äù Seeking some guidance, he found Michael Kami, who had led strategic planning for IBM and helped turn around Harley-Davidson. That seemed like an interesting combination. He lived on a yacht off of Miami. Yvon and the top leaders from the company flew to Florida. Kami asked, ‚ÄúWhy are you in business?‚Äù Yvon said, ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm in business to give money to environmental causes.‚Äù Kami said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs bullshit. You could sell the company, start a foundation, and give away a lot more money than you do now.‚Äù That brought Yvon up short. He thought about it for a while. He was still thinking about it a year later when the recession halted years of 30% to 50% growth. There was still 20% growth but the failure to meet expectations meant the company had to lay off 120 employees. Coming out of that, Yvon decided he was in business to prove that you could do things a different way. So for the past 30 years, rather than finding a compromise between doing well and doing good, we‚Äôre demonstra",Explorer,Patagonia,google_cse,https://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/how-patagonia-learned-to-act-on-its-values
"At the heart of every brand that dares to make a difference lies a set of core values that does more than just define the company; they inspire action. For many reasons, Patagonia stands above the rest because of their steadfast dedication to the planet and their spirited ethos that challenges and inspires businesses worldwide. They have set the gold standard for corporate responsibility and environmental advocacy, challenging the industry to follow their example. Here at Brighter Future, we admire Patagonia. We see their story as a call to arms - it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s a demonstration that true commitment to the betterment of the planet transcends rhetoric and marketing - it can be a lasting spark that ignites a new world of planet-driven business. A Journey Rooted in Purpose and Passion Patagonia's origins trace back to a backyard in Burbank, California, where Yvon Chouinard hand-crafted new equipment that spurred a revolution in outdoor climbing. Yet, it wasn't these products that made Patagonia synonymous with sustainability in business ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ it was their continued dedication to environmental activism and brand values that nurtured a culture of conscious consumerism. Their monumental leap towards ethical business practices began with a bold and pivotal choice to discontinue a product line that was lucrative but detrimental to the environment. This decision was a statement: a defining moment that set the foundation for the company‚Äö√Ñ√¥s future dedication to the planet. Patagonia's brand values were no longer just a marketing ploy; they were an internal compass guiding every decision. From Conception to Action The tenets of Patagonia's philosophy ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ quality, integrity, and environmental stewardship ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ are not mere buzzwords but reflected in initiatives like the ""Do Not Buy This Jacket"" campaign, an advertisement they ran in the New York Times featuring one of their best-selling products. Instead of promoting the product, the ad was an entire page advising consumers not to buy the product by highlighting the toll of fast fashion and providing in-depth information on the cost of the item, including the amount of water, carbon footprint, and waste necessary to make the jacket. The advertisement flipped the script on Black Friday, subverting the chaotic frenzy of consumer spending, by urging consumers to consider the environmental costs of their purchases; therefore embodying the essence of climate change action and sustainable manufacturing. Storytelling with Soul How does a brand keep the fires of activism burning in the hearts of its audience? For Patagonia, this means forging purposeful connections through the power of authentic storytelling. ¬¨‚Ä†Patagonia's tales of climbing the towering peaks of southern Chile, the namesake of the brand, are not just recollections but reflections of a deep-seated respect for the wild that they ardently protect. Their motto, ""We‚Äö√Ñ√¥re in the business of the planet,‚Äö√Ñ√π resonates because it's based on lived experience. Their stories are not just empty, concocted tales, but heartfelt actions that are etched into the very fabric of what makes them Patagonia. Outside of their own lived experiences, the company has highlighted a plethora of stories about environmental issues, including the debate over Bears Ears National Monument , the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and their role in supporting national parks in Chile . They‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve also joined the growing visual storytelling movement by producing several films that have focused on major topics in environmental conservation, including Artifishal , which focuses on the debate over fish hatcheries; Fishpeople , about individuals who share a connection to the ocean, and They/Them , which follows the story of a non-binary climber. Accountable, Authentic, United Transparency is the hallmark of true leadership. Patagonia's journey is not without its stumbles, yet their response ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ to address, adapt, and advance ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ exemplifies a brand that holds itself to the highest stand",Explorer,Patagonia,google_cse,https://www.brighterfuture.studio/blog/a-lesson-from-patagonia-on-developing-brand-values
"Patagonia company culture in action: How HR can apply these values anywhere A compass doesn‚Äôt make noise‚Äîbut it always knows where to point. That‚Äôs what values are like in a company. You may not talk about them every day, but if they‚Äôre real, they shape how people act, work, and make decisions‚Äîquietly and consistently. Patagonia is a good example of this. Their beliefs show up not just in what they sell, but in how they treat their people and make everyday choices. For HR teams, the takeaway isn‚Äôt to copy their style‚Äîit‚Äôs to build your own steady compass. One that helps your team stay true to what matters, no matter what. This blog breaks down how Patagonia‚Äôs culture works in practice and how HR teams can apply those lessons to build more purposeful workplaces. TL;DR Patagonia‚Äôs culture blends purpose, sustainability, and activism, showing how values can drive every decision and empower employees authentically. The company prioritizes people over profits through flexible policies, on-site childcare, activism support, and open communication. Transparency, employee autonomy, and DEI aren‚Äôt just initiatives‚Äîthey are embedded into Patagonia‚Äôs daily practices and leadership style.

HR leaders can learn to build resilient, people-first cultures by turning values into action and using tools like CultureMonkey to stay connected to employee sentiment. What is Patagonia‚Äôs company culture? TL;DR Patagonia‚Äôs culture blends environmental activism with employee autonomy and well-being. Its mission‚Äî‚Äúto save our home planet‚Äù‚Äîisn‚Äôt just a slogan, but a compass guiding decisions, empowering employees to align personal values with meaningful work. There‚Äôs no rigid hierarchy or corporate speak. Instead, the company fosters collaboration, flexibility, and belonging, creating a culture where purpose, not profit, defines success. Patagonia‚Äôs company culture is a blend of environmental activism, employee well-being, and a deep-rooted commitment to doing business differently. It‚Äôs not just about selling jackets; it‚Äôs about challenging the traditional idea of what a corporate identity should look like. The company fosters a purpose-driven culture where employees are encouraged to align their values with the company‚Äôs broader mission. That mission? ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in business to save our home planet by focusing on efforts to restore lands and ecosystems.‚Äù And yes, it‚Äôs more than just a tagline‚Äîit‚Äôs Patagonia‚Äôs north star. This purpose shows up in how people work, how decisions are made, and how employees feel empowered to take action, even if it means skipping work to attend a climate rally. That kind of flexibility isn‚Äôt accidental. The Patagonia work environment is intentionally built to give employees a sense of autonomy , meaning, and belonging. You won‚Äôt find rigid hierarchies or hollow corporate jargon here. Instead, there‚Äôs a genuine focus on collaboration , sustainability, and impact. What makes Patagonia‚Äôs company culture so unique? What makes Patagonia‚Äôs company culture so unique? There‚Äôs a difference between a company that talks values and one that breathes them.

"Patagonia was founded by Yvon Chouinard in 1973 to make clothing and equipment for rock climbers. Chouinard was an avid climber who believed in clean climbing with little impact on the outdoors. From the start Patagonia had a clear focus on environmental protection that reflected the personal ethics of its founder. It was the first California company to use renewable energy sources to power its buildings and one of the first to print its catalogs on recycled paper. Patagonia switched to 100% organically grown cotton in 1994 and removed chlorine from its wool products. Patagonia‚Äö√Ñ√¥s commercial success enabled it to become a visibly activist company. In 2018 it changed its mission statement to ‚Äö√Ñ√∫We‚Äö√Ñ√¥re in business to save our home planet.‚Äö√Ñ√π It also provides tools and funding to grassroots organizations. Growth is not the ultimate goal for Patagonia, yet their differentiation and environmental focus has helped them grow sustainably. 1. Align activities to environmental objectives Patagonia makes durability a strong constraint in the design and manufacturing of its outdoor clothing equipment, in order to align with its environmental objectives. The goal is to reduce consumption and waste. In addition, the company limits its environmental impact by maximizing the use of organic and recycled materials, by repairing damaged clothes, and by complying with strong environmental protection standards for its entire supply chain. 2. Develop sustainable value propositions Patagonia makes customers feel they are contributing to protecting the environment by extending its value proposition beyond the functional value proposition of high quality outdoor clothing and equipment. By buying Patagonia products, customers feel they are contributing to the highest environmental standards. Patagonia even launches a second-hand clothing value proposition to limit its environmental footprint and make its products accessible to a larger market. 3. Accept higher activity costs Patagonia‚Äö√Ñ√¥s high sustainability standards lead to higher costs. It uses more costly organic cotton, develops the infrastructure to recycle materials, and educates the public (Footprint Chronicles). It also bears the cost of making its supply chain more environmentally friendly by educating suppliers on sustainable practices. 4. Apply premium pricing Patagonia can charge a premium, because customers accept that environmental friendly production comes at a cost. The company‚Äö√Ñ√¥s customers are more environment-conscious than price-conscious.",Explorer,Patagonia,google_cse,https://www.strategyzer.com/library/patagonia-business-model
"If Patagonia create clothing that is more eco-friendly than other companies, they can still have a net negative effect on the environment if people buy their things that they wouldn't usually buy because they are drawn by their sustainable approach to outdoor clothing. We all know this. Buying products we don't need is still bad for the environment no matter how eco friendly they are. My theory: If people are going to buy outdoor clothing, having companies like Patagonia could be benefitial because customers could choose to buy their clothing which are more sustainable than competitor companies (assuming that they would buy clothing from less sustainable companies if Patagonia didn't exist) My question: Do more sustainable companies like Patagonia benefit the environment overall or do they cause an increase in demand for their clothing leading to people buying their clothes when they wouldn't otherwise? Thank you in advance!",Explorer,Patagonia,google_cse,https://www.reddit.com/r/PatagoniaClothing/comments/11s95xb/does_patagonia_do_anything_good_for_the/
"Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard, his spouse and two adult children are giving away their ownership in the apparel maker he started some 50 years ago, dedicating all profits from the company to projects and organizations that will protect wild land and biodiversity and fight the climate crisis. The company is worth about $3 billion, according to the New York Times . In a letter about the decision, published on the Patagonia website on Wednesday, Choiunard wrote of ""reimagining capitalism,"" and said: ""While we're doing our best to address the environmental crisis, it's not enough. We needed to find a way to put more money into fighting the crisis while keeping the company's values intact. One option was to sell Patagonia and donate all the money. But we couldn't be sure a new owner would maintain our values or keep our team of people around the world employed. Another path was to take the company public. What a disaster that would have been. Even public companies with good intentions are under too much pressure to create short-term gain at the expense of long-term vitality and responsibility. Truth be told, there were no good options available. So, we created our own."" The privately held company's stock will now be owned by a climate-focused trust and group of nonprofit organizations, called the Patagonia Purpose Trust and the Holdfast Collective respectively, the company said in a statement, noting ""every dollar that is not reinvested back into Patagonia will be distributed as dividends to protect the planet."" The trust will get all the voting stock, which is 2% of the total, and will use it to create a ""more permanent legal structure to enshrine Patagonia's purpose and values."" It will be overseen by members of the family and close advisors. The Holdfast Collective owns all the non-voting stock of Patagonia, which amounts to 98%. Patagonia expects to generate and donate about $100 million annually depending on the health of the business. The company now sells new and used outdoor apparel, gear for outdoor activities like camping, fishing and climbing, and food and beverages made from sustainable sources. As a certified B-Corp and California Benefit Corporation, Patagonia was already donating one percent of its sales each year to grassroots activists, and it intends to keep doing so. Fewer than 6,000 companies around the world are certified as B-Corp businesses . They have to meet strict environmental, social and governance standards and benchmarks set by B Labs to gain certification.

"What is the UNCRC? The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) is an important, legally binding agreement signed by 196 countries (as of 12 July 2022) which outlines the fundamental rights of every child, regardless of their race, religion or abilities. The UNCRC is the basis of all of our work. It is the most complete statement of children‚Äö√Ñ√¥s rights ever produced and is the most widely-ratified international human rights treaty in history. What is in the UNCRC? The Convention has 54 articles that cover all aspects of a child‚Äö√Ñ√¥s life and set out the civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. The convention is universal‚Äö√Ñ√Æthese rights apply to every child and the convention entitles every child to claim them. It also explains how adults and governments must work together to make sure all children can enjoy all their rights. Every child has rights, without discrimination of any kind against the child, parent, or legal guardian (Article 2). We should think of the Convention as a whole: each of the rights enshrined within it is interlinked, and no right is more important than another. The following rights are of equal importance to every child. Every child has the right to: Relax and play (Article 31) Freedom of expression (Article 13) Be safe from violence (Article 19) An education (Article 28) Protection of identity (Article 8) Sufficient standard of living (Article 27) Know their rights (Article 42) Health and health services (Article 24) We are the only o rganisation working for children r ecognised by the Convention.

"A brand manifesto is crucial for startups aiming to carve a unique identity in a competitive landscape. It serves as a foundational stone, guiding branding and decision-making with a clear declaration of your company's core values and vision. This vital document not only helps align your team but also communicates your startup's purpose and authenticity to customers, enhancing consumer connection and loyalty. ‚Äç In essence, a brand manifesto transforms your passionate vision into a strategic asset, steering your startup through its growth journey. A well-crafted brand manifesto not only articulates a startup‚Äôs aspirations but also embeds these ideals into the fabric of its culture, ensuring every business decision upholds these principles. ‚Äç ‚Äç What is a Brand Manifesto?

This document should include a powerful vision statement and mission statement that clearly outline the brand's aspirations and operational focus. ‚Äç By defining these elements, the manifesto helps shape the public perception and internal understanding of the brand's mission, ensuring that everyone is on the same page‚Äã. ‚Äç Motivating Employees and Enhancing Engagement Beyond external communication, a brand manifesto serves as a rallying cry for employees, encapsulating the emotional story that the organization believes in. This internal narrative fosters a work environment where employees are not only aware of the company's goal but are also emotionally invested in achieving it. ‚Äç By connecting the team's efforts with the brand's overarching purpose, the manifesto encourages a high level of engagement and commitment, aligning personal and organizational objectives for maximum impact. ‚Äç Building Customer Loyalty Through Emotional Connection A brand manifesto that effectively communicates the brand's purpose and values can deeply resonate with the target market, turning prospective customers into a loyal following.

"Craft a successful and engaging brand with a brand manifesto ‚Äì and shout it from the rooftops!

"17 Inspiring Brand Manifestos. by Chris Getman | Oct 30, 2018 Mission statements are dead. Those dull paragraphs, filled with vague aspirations of ‚Äúto help people and businesses throughout the world realize their full potential‚Äù* are a way of the past. Today‚Äôs customers simply do not have the time or will to care about lofty and overly general objectives. We don‚Äôt have the attention to focus on some innocuous mission statement; however it is the brand‚Äôs job to make us care, to inspire us, to challenge us, and even to offend us if necessary, as long as you get our attention. Mission statements are engineered to be general yet comprehensive, a statement that essentially stands for everything, which in reality, stands for nothing. Brands that want to set themselves apart will draw a line in the sand. Thankfully, there are those out there who are drawing these lines, and in doing so are creating more specific, transparent, and emotional stories to tell their customers why they exist, what they‚Äôre passionate about, and therefore why the customer should care. Enter the brand manifesto, a clear and public declaration of purpose and intent. When done right, a manifesto not only inspires customers, but inspires employees and attracts future talent. This authenticity is no longer negotiable for brands that want to cut through the clutter of their competition. It‚Äôs no longer enough to be ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù because customers are inundated with messages from brands trying to be ‚Äúdifferent.‚Äù Apple owns ‚ÄúThink Different‚Äù and may have ruined it for everyone else. But that‚Äôs ok, turn inwards and be authentic, strip away the marketing speak and bare who you are, even call out the chinks in your armor if necessary, that‚Äôs what authenticity is about.

"Since Karl Benz started production of the first car with an internal combustion engine in 1886, Germany has played a central role in automotive history. That was then, however, and as the pace of innovation accelerates, the future for leading German car manufacturers becomes uncertain. With electric and autonomous vehicles, aspects such as software and user experience become important differentiators. Are BMW, Mercedes Benz (formerly Daimler) and the VW Group prepared to go head-to-head in this arena with new challengers such as Tesla, Polestar, Build Your Dreams (BYD) and perhaps Apple? The German automotive industry In Germany, 7.2% of all employees work in the automotive sector; 892,000 people are employed directly, 1.6 million indirectly, and a further 680,000 work in induced positions. In 2022 automobiles and automobile parts constituted 15.6% of all German exports (more than 245 billion EUR) and became Germany‚Äôs most exported goods. In the same year, over 2.6 million German cars were sold within Germany, and another 2.6 million were exported worldwide. Mercedes Benz, BMW, and the VW Group make up the majority of these figures: Mercedes Benz‚Äôs revenue was 150 billion EUR in 2022 , BMW clocked 23.51 billion EUR, and the VW Group (with its 12 brands) turned over 279.2 billion EUR. In terms of net profits, they made 20.5 billion, 18.6 billion, and 15.8 billion EUR respectively, and together they account for round about 10% of the DAX -listed companies‚Äô market capitalization. No way around electric vehicles In recent years, Tesla‚Äôs arrival prompted many companies, managers, and stock market investors to predict dramatic disruption in the automotive sector. In response to this change in the market, German car manufacturers added several electric vehicles to their product fleets. According to the German magazine ‚ÄúAuto Motor und Sport‚Äù, 14,506 units of the electric brands of BMW, Mercedes Benz, and VW were first registered with the German Bundeskraftfahramt in December 2022. So, the German electric car industry is gaining steam. But they have a lot to lose if an unexpected player pulls the rug out from beneath their feet‚Ä¶ Troublemaker from overseas The most popular electric car brand today is Tesla, in particular the Model 3, of which 9,566 units were first registered in December 2022. But while the focus remains on Elon Musk‚Äôs brand and uprising Chinese e-car manufacturers, the biggest potential threat to the German automotive and mobility industry could be Apple. Tim Cook‚Äôs motivation A 2.5 trillion USD company, in 2022 Apple made 394 billion USD in revenue, slightly more than half of which came from iPhone sales with 205.5 billion USD. Its average margins are 36.3% on products and 71.7% on services. It has declared 94 billion USD in profit every year for the last two years‚Äîa doubling of the 57 billion in profits declared in Q4 2020). Apple's total assets in the fourth quarter of 2022 ran to 352.8 billion USD. In the second quarter of 2023, Apple declared 112.9 billion USD in current assets and 332.2 billion USD in total assets. If Apple wants to grow into a 4 or 6 trillion USD company, it needs to reach beyond its existing markets into areas that offer the opportunity to significantly increase its value. And Apple already has a lot of experience manufacturing products on a global scale, using contractors while ensuring high quality gets delivered. With the right contractor(s), an Apple car would fit right into its global supply chain. Apple also has other advantages over companies like Volkswagen, BMW, and Daimler: a huge user base plus experience in software development and user experience (UX) design. Furthermore, Foxconn, one of Apple‚Äôs largest suppliers, announced it is ready to start producing electric vehicles in October 2022.

To date‚Ä¶ Tesla‚Äôs primary products in the UK have been its vehicles ‚Äì becoming the most popular models at several points ‚Äì its Supercharger Network, and its Powerwall (a home battery storage system). Tesla also has started deploying large ‚ÄòMegapack‚Äô battery storage systems in the UK. What will ‚ÄòTesla Electric‚Äô look like? Based on the US model, it will empower British households to become ‚Äòmini power plants‚Äô by enabling them to generate, store, and trade renewable energy. Users can store energy in their Powerwalls (or their cars), sell excess electricity back to the grid, or share it with neighbours. The rates and benefits will vary depending on the level of involvement by the household - a large enough network of homes could help the grid avoid falling back onto fossil fuel. In the US‚Ä¶ homeowners can manage their entire system through an app, giving them control over their energy production, storage, and participation in real time‚Äã. Importantly, it is not just for ‚ÄòTesla fans‚Äô and in the US non-Tesla product owners can sign up too. See their page here . Screenshots of the Tesla Electric app in the US Why now? Across the globe, Tesla has started to lose its lead on EV sales. Yes, there has long been a promise of an affordable vehicle, but this still seems distant. In the face of increasingly intense competition, such as from China, it seems Tesla has decided instead to double down on energy. Only yesterday, Bloomberg reported ‚ÄúMusk now views Tesla as more of an AI, robotics and sustainable energy company than an EV company.‚Äù Last year‚Ä¶ It seemed Tesla was getting close to launching, as the company registered ‚ÄòTesla Energy Ventures‚Äô on Companies House in February 2023. Later in July, Tesla then advertised for a ‚Äò Head of Operations ‚Äô for Tesla Electric UK. One of the tasks for applicants would be to work with Ofgem to get the relevant licences to supply energy to homes and commercial properties. New hire‚Ä¶ It took them a while but, according to LinkedIn, last month Tesla appointed Roxanne Inskip-Kaye to the role. Roxanne previously held senior roles at other UK energy firms, including Social Energy and Ecotricity. And she seems to have had plenty of experience dealing with the UK's energy regulator ‚Äì online records suggest she‚Äôs previously crossed paths with James Crump (Head of Smart Metering) and Rachel Clark (Deputy Director, Retail Systems and Processes) at Ofgem as part of a working group . More vacancies‚Ä¶ And it‚Äôs not just Roxanne. In the UK, Tesla is advertising for seven roles within its energy teams, particularly for those deploying Powerwall and energy storage. Elsewhere, Tesla‚Äôs Texas-based Vice President of Tax, Joseph Gruber, was appointed to Tesla Energy Ventures Limited in March.

"Operation Sins of the Mother - Swifties and Chief's fans for the past few days have been review bombing the restaurant of CJ Gardner'-Johnson's mom and calling the ICE tip line to try to get the mom and employees deported. War between swifties and r/Fauxmoi , r/eagles, r/travisandtaylor. Hello, you may know me from the Cuck Chronicles, TikTok Drama, etc. Today I will write a relatively short post on the recent Taylor Swift Superbowl Drama that has been blown up, its not as entertaining as my prior post, but its entertaining enough that I will write about it --------------------------------- Context - A few days ago, The Eagles beat the KC Chiefs in the Superbowl. Taylor Swift and the President supported the KC Chiefs (more on how the president matters tangentially in this). Taylor because her boyfriend is in the Chiefs. The loss was pretty large margin wise, with Chief fans leaving early, such as the President. Swifties, are known as a very very very rabid fanbase on par with Kpop fans and gacha fans. They then started by review bombing the restaurant of one of the Eagles player's MOM's restaurants in Florida. Then they got a littttttle more unhinged and racist as over the course of a few hours they started calling the ICE tipline and then leaving racist remarks on his mom and family. The story, as of now has hit international news, but it started on X and Reddit swift fan groups and these posts are BEFORE it reached international news.

"""I'm not in California and I have freedom of movement. It's how I keep traveling to bang your dad."" /r/GayConservative reacts to the latest attempt to overturn Obergefell v. Hodges https://www.reddit.com/r/GayConservative/comments/1mng9kg/supreme_court_formally_asked_to_overturn_landmark/ # Background: [Kim Davis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Davis) is a former county clerk for Rowan County, Kentucky who gained notoriety in 2015 after defying a court order compelling her to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples in the wake of *[Obergefell v. Hodges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obergefell_v._Hodges)*. Davis, who has been married four times and had only recently converted to Christianity at the time, stated that it would ""violate [her] conscience"" to issue marriage licenses in violation of ""God's definition of marriage"", and claimed that the First Amendment right to religious freedom exempted her from having to comply with the outcome of *Obergefell*. In an attempt to circumvent the Supreme Court's decision, Davis refused to issue marriage licenses to any couples regardless of sex. Unsurprisingly, a [lawsuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_v._Davis) was filed against her, ultimately culminating in the U.S. District Court ordering her to issue marriage licenses to all couples. Davis appealed the ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals, and when that failed, she turned to the Supreme Court and was denied once again. Following the court's decision, Davis continued to deny marriage licenses to couples despite the court's orders. Davis was jailed for contempt of court, and was released after five days on the condition that she not prevent her deputy clerks from issuing marriage licenses in her place. In July 2025, Davis [submitted a petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-formally-asked-overturn-landmark-same-sex/story?id=124465302) requesting that *Obergefell v. Hodges* be overturned, citing *[Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women%27s_Health_Organization)* as precedent. This has been met with concern, as the current Supreme Court is majority conservative, with Justice Thomas [specifically citing *Obergefell* as a case he'd like to overturn](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/thomas-wants-supreme-court-overturn-landmark-rulings-legalized-contrac-rcna35228) in his concurrence on *Dobbs*. # Highlights: [Who saw that coming?](https://www.reddit.com/r/GayConservative/comments/1mng9kg/supreme_court_formally_asked_to_overturn_landmark/n8526ox/) &gt; Stevie Wonder even saw this üò≠ ___ [Good job everybody.

"I have been stalking local Bath and Body Work stores for 5 months and believe they are going to crush earnings. Edit - Well damn. EPS and revenue beat but guidance is king these days. Holding onto the calls at this point in case a miracle happens but counting the full 8k as a loss. Only down 1.7k on shares so far but if it does the same thing it has done the last 3 quarters, it will rebound to new highs so not too worried. Congratulations to all the Bears and better luck next time to all the Bulls with me. I believe BBWI is going to crush earnings based on 5 months of store stalking and no one is talking about it. Literally not one mention about earnings on wallstreetbets. TLDR at the end. **Background:** I have been on paternity leave for a little over 5 months now. I live 20 minutes away from 3 different malls and thought I walking around them for an hour or two every day would be a great way to kill some time while also letting my newborn see new things. Around the same time I watched a video on how a Chinese coffee shop got outed for fake financials by people literally watching the store and counting the number of people buying things. That gave me the idea to track how many people were in stores and how many shopping bags I saw around the mall from each store indicating a purchase. Obviously there is a major difference between dozens of people watching stores vs just little old me but the data I gathered has been spot on for earning beats on what I considered to be outliers. The stores that have surprised me with their high volume are Gap, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, Urban Outfitters, Sephora, and of course Bath and Body Works. **Method:** All in all I have 124 days worth of data so far. I usually only visit one mall a day but sometimes two. Any day of the week and usually between 12pm and 5pm. I try and park at different entrances so I don‚Äôt get biased in my counting of bags because I park right next to one store or another. I go to three different malls each catering to a different economic class. Pretty much lower, middle, and high income. I do 2 passes, about and hour apart, of each store I am tracking. I count the number of customers in the store. While I walk around, I also count the number of bags I see from each store. This is a bit harder to trust though as people with multiple bags usually condense into one. So stores with small bags (looking at you Sephora) are underrepresented. I would occasionally go into BBWI and count the items in people carts too but only did this a handful of times. **Data:** The average number of people I have seen at BBWI is 9.82 on weekdays and 23.68 on weekends. This crushes the average from all the stores I tracked which was 2.98 on weekdays and 8.2 on weekends. The only store with a higher average was Sephora which was 10.36 and 25.25 respectfully. All three malls had similar numbers with the higher income mall being slightly higher but not enough to note. I think this was due to young girls traveling in packs of 3 or 4 which I didn‚Äôt see at the other two malls. The average number of bags (aka purchases) for BBWI was 4.1 on weekdays and 11.67 on weekends. Which again crushes the average of just 1.45 and 3.11. For some context here are pictures of the check out line Saturday 30 minutes apart. Wanted to hide people because I think it is rude for a random stranger to snap pictures of people and post them online. There are currently multiple tellers checking out customers with 5 more people in line. https://preview.redd.it/j7utbegx6d4d1.png?width=1485&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66905e26bba9ebd5134ef3e817efaaf26b45b8cc 30 minutes later and still 5 people in line https://preview.redd.it/dbjon4ep6d4d1.png?width=1493&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ce85d8724ee99cd47b3e79a3b0bbaa7112b79bc **Other Things to Note** **Male Skin Care** \- Something I didn‚Äôt track, but surprised me, was the number of males in the store alone or with another guy (this goes for Sephora as well).

"Ceiling Boxed. The MOASS is upon us. For real. Hello beautiful apes, I have some things to share with you that I feel we need to internalize as a community. This is not hopium, and it is not FUD. This is somewhere in the middle. Giving a realistic perspective on what's actually going on. And it is important that we grasp the severity of the real situation so no one gets trapped anymore. And the real reason why MOASS is finally upon us. No hype baiting, no calls to action, no dates. Just sharing my perspective with some strong opinions, speculation, a fun story, and some pictures of charts. There are 3 sections. **Section 1: Addressing today** **Section 2: Story / Thought Experiment** **Section 3: Review of charts with lessons learned.** &amp;#x200B; Let's get into it. &amp;#x200B; **Section 1: Addressing today** I know today sucked. I'm mad that I was right. I was hoping it wouldn't be a rug pull. I was hoping the subtle call to action with a time sensitivity that came out of nowhere promising the moon if you do this **one thing**... would be true. But we need to learn from this. I posted 2 posts prior to this one saying to be skeptical about it. But because neither post went with the narrative being spun, it didn't get any traction. I tried to warn to be cautious of the options trap. My only thought was.. this looks too perfect. It has to be a trap. Because MOASS will just fucking happen.. It won't be laid out on the charts. It won't be a subtle bread crumb that we find. It won't be predictable. Someone's not going to come out of nowhere and say ""GUYS LOOK AT THIS THING I FOUND IN THE CHART AND IT WILL HAPPEN ON THIS DAY AND ONLY THIS DAY BECAUSE XYZ""... It will be a sudden violent shift up. It will be a fucking Tsunami that hits everyone by surprise. It will be an asteroid in the dark. A black hole that swallows the entire financial sector and there's not a damned thing they can do to stop it. And not a damned thing any one of us, neither individually nor collectively can do to make it happen any faster. The only thing I as an individual investor can do to secure the investment that I believe in, is to buy, hold and make sure that share is in my fucking name by direct registering it. That's all. Nothing else. Options.. somebody show me one law that states MM must hedge with **shares** which drives a gamma squeeze? Someone show me a law that states the calls being exercised must be purchased on a **lit exchange**, and can **not** be a synthetic fake share that they internalized? BY ALL MEANS if you want to buy calls, and exercise them.. Go for it. That is your right as an investor. Make your bets. And exercise your rights if you feel inclined. But make sure those shares are DRS'd once you receive them. Because if you're exercising with the idea that it will create a gamma squeeze, that won't happen. Not when they control the whole system. This whole game, the system of rules and regulations and agencies to protect investors and the media are all controlled by them. They are created by them, for them. The call battle was lost today due to people trading options on emotions. Not logic. They used emotions to bait people into buying calls and pulled the rug from under them. *NONE OF THIS IS FINANCIAL ADVICE. I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR.

Doing so would also be a tacit admission that decades of democratic policies in various cities have failed to address these problems, hence the silly and limp-wristed insistence that crime stats are marginally improving every year, etc. Their only real idealogy is not doing anything to disrupt the status quo (you know, the status quo every American loves, where freaks who are one wrong look away from murdering you in cold blood are just out walking the streets alongside everyone else). Not one single 2028 contender for the Democrats is getting ahead of these political issues and saying ""Yeah, we messed up, we do need to do better on crime.""

"Tyrese Haliburton is the first player since 1943 to make a Finals last-second game-winner while trailing. No, really. Let's go backwards, shot by shot. **Game 1 of the 1997 Finals**, Michael Jordan sinks a beautiful jumper just inside the three-point line with Bryon Russell lost in his dust, as the buzzer sounds. But when he took the shot, the score was 82-82. Had he missed, they simply would've gone into overtime.^(1) **Game 4 of the 1985 Finals**, Dennis Johnson receives a pass, 21 feet out, from a double-teamed Larry Bird and calmly lets it fly into the net relatively uncontested, with what was probably actually a fraction of a second left but the refs ruled it as no time on the clock, game over. But when he took the shot, the score was 105-105. Had he missed, they simply would've gone into overtime.^(2) **Game 1 of the 1979 Finals**, Larry Wright draws a controversial foul by Dennis Johnson at the buzzer and hits two of three (the three to make two rule was still in effect) free throws with no time on the clock to clinch it. But when he took the shot, the score was 97-97. Had he missed all three, they simply would've gone into overtime.^(3) **Game 1 of the 1976 ABA Finals**, Julius Erving caught an inbound pass, drove to the right baseline around 20 feet from the basket, and sank the game-winner in a fashion many today might find a little reminiscent of a certain Kawhi Leonard shot but without needing the help of the rim on the way in. But when he took the shot, the score was 118-118. Had he missed it, they simply would've gone into overtime.^(4) **Game 3 of the 1962 Finals**, Jerry West and Frank Selvy did a great job of surrounding Bob Cousy on an inbounds pass from Sam Jones with three seconds to go, West intercepts it and breaks away to lay it in before the buzzer sounds. But when he took the shot, the score was 115-115. Had he missed it, they simply would've gone into overtime.^(5) **Game 4 of the 1962 ABL Finals**, Connie Dierking breaks to the free throw line just as the ball is inbounded, receives a perfect pass from Dick Barnett, and turns and sinks a right-handed hook with one second remaining. But when he took the shot, the score was 98-98. Had he missed it, they simply would've gone into overtime.^(6) **Game 6 of the 1957 Finals**, Cliff Hagan (a rookie!) ""leaped four feet off the floor to tip in the ball"" (obviously an exaggeration) on the rebound of an off-balance last-gasp Bob Pettit miss. But when he took the shot, the score was 94-94. Had he missed it, they simply would've gone into overtime.^(7) **Game 1 of the 1950 Finals**, Bob Harrison (also a rookie!) receives an outlet pass from George Mikan after Mikan blocked an Al Cervi layup. He takes three dribbles and launches up a shot from one step inside of half-court, and it goes right in. But when he took the shot, the score was 66-66.

"The Force Awakens was never a good movie A widely shared opinion within the Star Wars community holds that the Sequel Trilogy started off strong, but went off the rails with The Last Jedi, directed by Rian Johnson. According to fans, Johnson strayed too far from the path set by J.J. Abrams, generating a fragmented and contradictory history. However, blaming Rian Johnson alone would be an oversimplification. The truth is that The Force Awakens wasn't a good movie either. It was a blatant copy of A New Hope. Fans often remember it with nostalgia, as a broken promise or the first glimmer of hope after years of silence. But that promise was hollow from the start: The Force Awakens was a corporate play carefully designed to stir predictable emotions, not to tell a new story. It was a product born in a marketing laboratory, not in the mind of a creator with an artistic vision. J.J. Abrams, aware of the rejection that many fans felt towards the Prequels, decided to play it safe: imitate the Original Trilogy in form, rhythm and structure. In the process, he betrayed the original plans that George Lucas had written before selling Lucasfilm. Abrams and Disney feared risk and therefore sacrificed imagination. What moved the company was not the Star Wars myth or its narrative potential, but its value as an image and as a brand. Disney did not buy Star Wars to continue an epic, but to exploit a collective nostalgia. His goal was to emotionally ‚Äúreactivate‚Äù the audience, not offer them something new. The strategy was simple: take every iconic element of the Original Trilogy, wrap it in a modern design, and present it as a ‚Äútriumphant return.‚Äù In reality, The Force Awakens was a covert remake, a repackaged version of Episode IV, conceived by an algorithm that is afraid of risk. It was less an act of love for cinema than an exercise in commercial calculation. At this point, Star Wars stopped being a story and became a simulation of itself: an empty representation, perfectly designed to provoke dopamine in the viewer. The saddest thing is that it worked. The filming of The Force Awakens was promoted as an homage to ‚Äúclassic cinema‚Äù: 35mm filming, real sets, practical effects, models and animatronic creatures. Everything seemed like a return to the artisanal spirit of Lucas's cinema. But what was presented as authenticity was, in reality, a meticulous simulacrum, a staging designed to disguise its prefabricated nature. While the public cried with emotion at the supposed revival of Star Wars, no one stopped to ask why the air in the theater smelled so much of plastic and cheap nostalgia. George Lucas was one of the few voices to speak out against this approach. He described The Force Awakens as a soulless repetition, a betrayal of the experimental spirit that had characterized his work. But society, intoxicated by marketing, ridiculed him. The irony is cruel: the creator of Star Wars was silenced by the same cultural machine his universe had helped inspire. And yet, Disney won. The Force Awakens grossed more than two billion dollars, surpassing The Phantom Menace and becoming the highest-grossing film of 2015, as well as the biggest commercial success in the history of The Walt Disney Company. Disney showed that, in contemporary cinema, you don't need to have imagination to succeed; It is enough to know how to manipulate the emotional memory of the public. Star Wars was no longer a saga about the Force, myth or redemption. It was, and remains, a mirror of our consumer culture: a packaged souvenir, a recyclable product designed to sell the illusion of return.

"""I honestly don‚Äôt think either of them is worth voting for."" Voters discuss whether you really have to vote for the lesser evil on... /r/neoliberal??? Famously middle-of-the-road /r/neoliberal prides itself on being evidence-based and pragmatic. The primary for New York City mayor has put that to the test. The first frontrunners is ex-governor Andrew Cuomo who has been accused of sexual harassment by multiple women, has been accused of corruption, is Italian ü§å, and has been endorsed by centrist democrats like Bill Clinton, Mike Bloomberg, and Rep Jim Clyburn. Next, state representative Zohran Mamdani is a democratic socialist (a ""succ"" in /r/neoliberal parlance) who is in favor of maintaining prices on rent controlled units, free bus fares, government-run grocery stores, and has been endorsed by /r/neoliberal darlings Bernie Sanders, AOC, and Hasan Piker. For the users of /r/neoliberal, it's a match made in hell. If the average poster was stuck in a room with Cuomo, Mamdani, and a gun loaded with a single bullet, they'd eat the gun. Whoever wins, /r/neoliberal loses. It's best summed up by a comment I saw, reading: &gt; Cuomo v Mamdani could not be a more perfect schism-able debate for this sub. &gt; On the one hand you have a Centrist Democrat with a poor track record of leadership (especially on city issues) and a lot of baggage, including accusations of sexual harassment. On the other hand you have a DSA Candidate (with a leftist track record) calling for Rent Control BUT with some credible YIMBY endorsements. &gt; So it's a ""lesser evil"" debate but with each coming with HUGE caveats to this sub's whole ethos. Whatever you compromise on, you're wrong one way or another. &gt; It was like this was cooked up in a lab to piss this sub off.

"[Web Media] Critical Role and Orion Acaba: How to get kicked out of what is now Twitch's most successful channel so hard, people don't even know you were part of the show If this post sounds familiar to you, you may remember that this *was* a topic previously on /r/HobbyDrama[ in the sweet Summers of 2020.](https://www.reveddit.com/v/HobbyDrama/comments/hu3ooj/critical_role_the_ballad_of_tiberius_stormwind/?limit=500) I specifically remember reading this while on vacation. However, the original author seems to have either deleted their account or taken the post down, so I decided to revive the post. Back when Removeedit worked for Reddit posts I could link to the text itself but that unfortunately seems to have shut down. Anyway, let's get into this: &gt; **What's Critical Role?** Beginning in early 2015, Critical Role is a live-streamed game of Dungeons and Dragons helmed by several popular voice actors such as Matthew Mercer (Jotaro Kujo, Leon Kennedy, [Maximus from Leo the Lion\)](https://twitter.com/matthewmercer/status/972360731567050752?lang=en), Travis Willingham (Thor, Roy Mustang, [this store owner in Nip/Tuck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu95M2Xy2Ig)) and Laura Bailey (Rise from Persona 4, the Female Boss in Saints Row 3/4, [Kaine in Nier\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E71tZ-NWPIg). If you were an anime fan watching dubs from the mid 2000s to the mid 2010s or you just played a video game, I guarantee you heard at least one of these actors in something. It's a veritable who's-who of big name voice actors. While recording for Resident Evil 6, Mercer decided to give a birthday present to Liam O'Brien, specifically a one-shot D&amp;D game. This was run in the... controversial... 4th edition version of the game, and presumably after Mercer took a visit to his local exorcist, realized the error of his ways. When O'Brien expressed interest in continuing the game, Mercer agreed and they shifted to Pathfinder. The crew share some stories as they go, with it becoming a frequent thing that gets brought up during convention panels as a fun aside. Back before Vine died it was very common to see the actors making Vines of tabletop moments, and some of the original campaign was preserved [through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-M5NH9PGi4) [Youtube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rsks5PWfG8) The team go by the name Vox Machina- latin for Voice Machine, but initially they operated under the name Super High Intensity Team, or... The SHITS. I will actually be shocked if they refernece that old name in the cartoon. The party for Campaign 1 consisted of: * Matt Mercer as DM. * Marisha Ray as Keyleth, Half-Elf Druid. * Liam O'Brien as Vax, Half-Elf Rogue. * Laura Bailey as Vex, Half-Elf Ranger. * Travis Willingham as Grog, Goliath Barbarian. * Ashley Johnson as Pike, Gnome Cleric. * Sam Riegel as Scanlan, Gnome Bard. * Taliesen Jaffe as Percy, Human Fighter. * Orion Acaba as Tiberius, Dragonborn Sorcerer. Fast forward about two years and Ashley Johnson is at a small party where she meets up with Felicia Day, who is running a nerdy celebrity Youtube channel called Geek and Sundry. Ashley shares some stories about the game and Felicia offers them a show slot on their Twitch channel, seeing potential for this to go far. And as such, on March 3rd, 2015, after an internal conversion to Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition (a move that I'm pretty sure that the 5e team thank God for given how much money they've made that brand), [Critical Role would begin its slow, gradual process towards world domination.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-p9lWIhcLQ) This first episode is *jank* and I adore it with every fibre of my soul.

"[Literature] BBC's The Watch, or, how to piss on the grave of one of the most beloved fantasy authors of all time Adaptations of beloved works are often approached very, very cautiously. From [Peter Johnson](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0814255/) to [Ong](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0938283/), there have been a whole host of bad adaptations, leaving fans of any book terrified when news of an adaptation is announced. But one man had a brilliant idea. What if, the issue with all those previous adaptations was that they ruined *too little*? What if, the answer was to take all the most beloved plots and characters of 41 separate books, mash them up into a disgusting homunculus, shove some steampunk up its ass, and ruin all of them *together*? Oh, and also disrespect the beloved dead author whose express wishes you're ignoring, and kick out his daughter. Welcome to *The Watch*. **Disclaimer**: At certain points during this write up, you may think, ""Gee, this whole thing just seems like a massive ad to get people to read Terry Pratchett's work"". It is. You should read it. (Come on. Read it. You'll like it.) However, it's also a dive into some truly excellent drama, and a massive amount of untold history that I've done my best to dredge up and collect in one place. Hopefully, even if you're already aware of this, there'll be some new parts of it in here for you. A lot of this information has been kept as secret as the BBC could, or was scattered around. I tried to go a bit further than most of the news sources I found, and create a whole picture of *why* this became such a travesty. This is a topic I'm very passionate about, and the writeup can get a tad long, so I've included a TL;DR in bold at the end of each section in case you don't really care that much about the details, or get lost. # Our story begins... and a man's story ends **Who is Terry Pratchett?** (If you're asking this question, refer to the disclaimer above.) Terry Pratchett is one of the most successful and beloved fantasy(ish) authors in the business. His website [here](https://www.terrypratchettbooks.com/about-sir-terry/) has a dive into his life. The part that's most important to this writeup is his career as a writer, specifically, the Discworld series. Starting in 1983 with *The Color of Magic*, Pratchett would go on to write a staggering *41 books* in the Discworld series. Think of it almost like the MCU: there are many stories, some of which cross over, all existing in the same shared universe. These varied wildly; with one being about a turtle god, and the next being an in depth look at sexism in the military, while a third focused on the perils of having dwarves in your condom factory. Despite the varying topics, Sir Terry's trademark wry humor and satire was always present. One of the most popular sub-series is the eight City Watch books. It focuses on the Ankh Morpork Night's Watch, headed up by Sam Vimes, with a wide supporting cast. They were the underdog cops in a city where crime was legal. Vimes was one of Pratchett's most popular characters, an everyman who rose from being an impoverished drunk to the most respected and feared hand of justice in the world. It's a series full of discussion and satire on politics, monarchy, racism, sexism, and justice, which also has genuinely loveable characters in hilarious situations. Pratchett was also just a remarkably good person. He remained down to earth, living a modest lifestyle with his family even as he gained fame and money. His daughter Rhianna remembers him missing deadlines and work just so that he could take her out to explore the countryside, or tell her stories. He was ecstatic at receiving a knighthood, so much so that he forged his own sword out of a meteorite, and hid it afterwards, leaving it missing to this day. A lot of his ideas came from D&amp;D campaigns he'd run for kids while volunteering at the local library. And that's all setting aside the major donations he made to different charities",Caregiver,Johnson & Johnson,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/z6apqy/literature_bbcs_the_watch_or_how_to_piss_on_the/
"OOP's local chess club is run by an extremely obvious cheater [Long] **Reminder: I am not the OP. Originals posted by /u/ChessCheatConundrum in /r/AnarchyChess and on their profile.** Mood Spoilers: &gt;!Mostly just...weird?!&lt; ___________________ #[Chess club is run by a cheater. What should I do?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnarchyChess/comments/skw5jx/chess_club_is_run_by_a_cheater_what_should_i_do/) *- Feb 04, 2022* I recently began attending a new chess club that meets in person. After a few weeks, I discovered that the person who organizes it is a cheater. He uses his phone in a fairly elaborate way to determine the top computer moves, then plays those against unsuspecting opponents. He claims to be one of the best players in the state, but is actually a complete novice who barely understands the game. It looks like he‚Äôs been cheating for years, for literally every move he plays in every single game. There‚Äôs no financial incentive here, he just crushes amateurs every week in hours-long, casual games. What should I do about this? Anything at all? I haven‚Äôt told anyone yet and he doesn‚Äôt yet suspect I know. Should I mess with him? Call him out publicly? Ignore it and mind my own business? Is this something anyone else has experienced before? Any advice would be welcome. For the hardcore among you who want to know the full story with all the details, grab yourself a beverage, strap in, and enjoy: I just moved to a new area and saw the local library has weekly in-person chess club meetings. When I walked in, the organizer greeted me and asked if I was up for a game. I was, so he added a couple hours to the clock and we started to play. I didn‚Äôt think much of his phone and Bluetooth headset since he mentioned he was keeping track of sports scores. The more distractions for my opponent, I thought, the better. He played an opening I‚Äôm familiar with to a level past my familiarity. After about an hour and 20 moves later I blundered and was quickly checkmated. ‚ÄúGood game,‚Äù I said, and asked if he wanted to review. He stood over the board as I replayed the moves and quipped, ‚Äúyou messed up on move three. No coming back after that.‚Äù I was slightly offended because, while odd-looking, the move was the main theoretical reply, which he must have known since we both played it fairly deeply. He didn‚Äôt seem to recognize the name of the opening when I said it and just kind of shrugged and agreed with me before walking away. Maybe he had a super sarcastic or troll-like sense of humor, I figured. After analyzing the game in Stockfish I saw he played perfectly. 100% agreement with the engine which came out to 9 cpl. I made four inaccuracies with about 40 cpl. My GM coach rarely played this accurately against me but it was still possible, especially if I made early mistakes. I noticed a few other oddities like him avoiding a forcing, straightforward mate-in-9 sequence to find a complex and non-forcing mate-in-7. Also odd was how little time he spent on each move, especially compared to the first 2-3 moves which took him forever to decide upon. Overall, I was glad to have found such a strong player to learn from and looked up his rating. He had a USCF ID but no history of playing in the last 20 years. ‚ÄúI used to play tournaments in the 70‚Äôs and 80‚Äôs,‚Äù he later explained, claiming he was a 2250 National Master. ‚ÄúBut much stronger now.‚Äù Coincidentally it turns out my former coach was also a very prolific player during that time and in the same area, but the organizer didn‚Äôt recognize his name. And his USCF ID was only a few years old without any listed ratings or anything. I did a web search but the guy had seemingly no history beyond the club website which he wrote. There he listed himself as a 2203 NM. There was also a club ranking page with his name and photo and placed on top, with a description, ‚Äúregarded as the strongest player in {area} and one of the top players in {state}.‚Äù He ranked himself above a local \~2300 FIDE Master, later claimi",Caregiver,Johnson & Johnson,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/xigymh/oops_local_chess_club_is_run_by_an_extremely/
"12 Reasons Why Padme Should Have Just Joined Anakin I'm being slightly sarcastic, but to be fair it also just kinda makes sense. My case to Padme in convincing her to stick with Anakin: 1. Stay with your husband during his career transition to a new organization. Is that really a tall ask? I also hear it's quite the promotion! 2. You don't get choked. Always a good thing! 3. No more sneaking around. AND your husband keeps a job without being ousted and publicly shamed for daring to have a personal life. How long was that really going to last, let's be honest, Padme... 4. You get to raise your kids, and Leia doesn't have only vague memories of you despite never meeting you. This is ideal! Your son won't have his entire life ruined, and your daughter won't have to be raised by Jimmy Smits! 5. The Jedi, in particular Windu, never trusted Anakin, and never treated him much better than he was treated when he was a slave. Even when his mother was in danger, it was not made a priority by the Jedi council. For a bunch of space monks claiming to be of the 'light' side, they show zero compassion or care for the alleged ""chosen one"". They treat him like a tool, and nothing more. As his wife, you should see this, and understand why this isn't a productive environment for your husband. Also, look how happy Palpy is, what a good guy! 6. Your husband possibly isn't doomed to be in an iron lung and gets to keep his Johnson. This is both good for him AND you! 7. You're already ""talking like a Separatist"", well good news! Your husband is going to be on their side... well, until he kills them... 8. Kids get the coolest ""Uncle"" (Palpatine) of all time! And future career options are massive! Helping your husband rule the galaxy... or working on a moisture farm, not a hard choice, here. 9. You can stay in politics! Don't worry about having your job at the Senate dismissed; You can become a regional governor! That has a nice ring to it! 10. You finally don't have to ride around the Galaxy in your old mirror paint job ship that has a replacement engine in it and needs a bunch of droids to keep the shields up. Let's trade in that sucker for a brand new Lambda Class Imperial Shuttle with TWO, count 'em TWO shield generators! Wow! 11. Alderaan likely won't be to be destroyed, now. You've literally saved the lives of millions of people, how noble! 12.

"Oh you think I‚Äôm your personal travel agent. Ok then‚Ä¶ So I‚Äôm in the military and we have this system that we use called the Defense Travel System or DTS that is used to book our airfare, hotel, rental car, etc. Everyone who travels does their own booking in the system and submits it for approval. My supervisor, who is a brand new 22 year old 2nd Lieutenant didn‚Äôt want to learn how to use the system and always made me book her trips for her last minute because I was an administrator. Anyways no matter how many times I told her she needed to do it herself and showed her how to use the system, she‚Äôd always wait until the last minute to get anything done and book her flights. Because of this I was always having to get on the phone with the commercial travel office to book her flights last minute. Finally I had enough and figured this girl is never going to do this herself and I will always be stuck taking care of it last minute. So I started booking her trips for her in DTS as she had wanted me to do all along. So I did. I made sure her flight left at the earliest possible time and had the longest layovers available, seat was the middle seat in the last row for all her flights, I removed her known traveler number in the system so she wouldn‚Äôt get precheck, I booked her hotel at the lowest cost hotel in the system so usually a Motel 6 or Howard Johnson even though Hiltons and Marriott were within the cap, and on occasion I booked her rental car at an offsite location that didn‚Äôt have a shuttle to it.

"[TTRPG Streams] It's your turn to roll (on out of here): Brian Foster leaves Critical Role Disclaimer: A lot of what happened has been kept private by both sides. I tried to stick only to known facts and fan response. Any speculation is kept to a minimum, and clearly labeled as such. **What is Critical Role?** Critical Role is a group of nerdy-ass voice actors who sit around and play Dungeons and Dragons. The group started off as friends, all of whom were professional voice actors. It'd take way too long to list all of their [roles](https://critrole.com/membertype/cast-members/), but suffice to say that if you've ever watched an anime dub, or played a AAA videogame, odds are you've heard at least one of them. The group got together to play a D&amp;D session for Liam O'Brien's birthday, and enjoyed it so much they started a long running campaign (for non-TTRPG people, a campaign is a number of sessions with the same characters, working towards bigger goals). In 2015, Geek and Sundry producer Felicia Day heard about the game and approached the group about streaming it as part of Geek and Sundry's content. They agreed, and the first stream exploded. It was a perfect storm situation: Geek culture was becoming mainstream at the same time as D&amp;D was experiencing a resurgence in pop culture with the simplified fifth edition. Combine that with a group of professional actors, writers, and comedians, and a near total lack of competing D&amp;D streams, and Geek and Sundry had a hit. The show exploded, and has been going steady ever since, eventually separating from Geek and Sundry to become their own company. They're currently on their third campaign, and have produced a successful animated TV adaptation (doing so through a record breaking $11,300,000 kickstarter), several books, multiple comics, and an official partnership with Wizards of the Coast to make official D&amp;D content. A [Twitch leak](https://www.wepc.com/news/twitch-leaks-critical-role-earnings-payout/) revealed Critical Role to be one of the highest grossing streamers on the platform, making over three million a year from the stream alone. They also kicked off a Renaissance of other D&amp;D streams, with everyone and their grandmother deciding that they'd be the next CR. A niche market with a handful of streamers became a massive genre, with thousands of options. In most other writeups on this sub, this would be the point where I reveal that the cast are secretly Nazis/domestic abusers/scammers, but... (so far), that hasn't happened. They started a charity organization and have donated frequently; they're generally friendly and down to earth with fans; they use their position of power to advertise lesser known content creators; they've made an increasing point of including diversity both in their fantasy world and staff. The only major cast drama occurred very early on when Orion Acaba got kicked out (read u/GoneRampant's [writeup](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/q5c2xf/web_media_critical_role_and_orion_acaba_how_to/) for more), and even that was handled quietly and maturely. While drama absolutely happens, it's almost always with the fans, not the cast. Honestly, it's more than a little freaky how non-dickish they are. However, as you may have guessed by the sub, drama did come. Not for the main cast, but for one of their friends and employees: Brian Foster. **Who is Brian Foster?** Brian had begun dating cast member Ashley Johnson back in 2012.

"The State of Tariffs &amp; Crowdfunding for Board Games (Tariffs on Board Games are NOT 245%) ‚Äî Bitewing Games As a board game publisher operating in one of the most turbulent situations that this industry has ever seen, I‚Äôm noticing a lot of misinformation and assumptions floating around lately. This post is intended to help inform hobbyists (and possibly help some publishers as well) about the state of tariffs and crowdfunding for board games. # How will publishers handle the new tariff of 245%? This is a brand new rumor running rampant today, yet it is not true for most goods (including board games). This rumor started due to a [White House Fact Sheet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-ensures-national-security-and-economic-resilience-through-section-232-actions-on-processed-critical-minerals-and-derivative-products/) posted late yesterday which states, ‚ÄúChina faces *up to* a 245% tariff on imports to the United States as a result of its retaliatory actions.‚Äù Many folks (myself included) initially assumed that this was effectively a new executive order that piled an extra 100% on top of existing tariffs. But that is not the case. A few days ago the [New York Times shared](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/12/business/economy/china-tariff-product-costs.html) a helpful summary that describes the range of tariffs for goods coming from China. Notably, syringes and needles have a tariff rate of 245% currently because they already had a pre-existing tariff of 100% before this trade war began. **Most goods (including board games) are still at 145%** (which is significantly lower but obviously still painful). [NYT Article](https://preview.redd.it/8eurjmz0aave1.png?width=1036&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0c0ecd0a99003c8db9180f2cf10b8f259b94df3) And here is a [USA Today article](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/04/16/trump-china-tariff-245-percent-trade-war/83114710007/) from today talking about the confusion. # Can‚Äôt publishers just manufacture board games outside of China to avoid these tariffs? This has already been covered quite extensively by other sources, so I‚Äôll stick to the short answer here: Most publishers cannot. The US has bare-bones infrastructure/ability to produce board games as we know them. It would take years of investment to catch up to China‚Äôs capabilities, and the result would still be much more expensive than manufacturing in China with these tariffs. **China is by far the global leader in board game manufacturing, and that will not change over night.** # Even with a 145% tariff, are publishers toast? That depends on a lot of factors: **Sales model (retail vs direct)** Publishers who rely heavily on retail sales will be hurt the most. With the cost of producing a game more than doubling (in the US), that means that the MSRP should nearly double to maintain the same margins. This is because publishers sell their games wholesale (to retailers and distributors) at a significant percentage discount (roughly 50-65% off) so that it is also profitable for those sellers. But a $30 game suddenly selling for $60 isn‚Äôt going to go very far in the market. So do publishers only increase prices a bit and eat the remaining losses? It‚Äôs a tough situation to be in. Conversely, a publisher who sells their games direct to customers is not taking nearly as big of a hit. Where a $6 game may now cost $15 due to tariffs, the publisher would only have to increase their selling price by $9 (instead of $30) to maintain the same margins. **Sources of Income** Publishers with international localization, digital apps, popular merchandise (not made in China), and other sources of income outside of Chinese-made products will be able to fare the tariffs better. **Regional sales (US vs International)** Fortunately the cost to sell games outside of the US has not increased. So publishers who have more international sales avenues will be hurt less.

"[OC] How a basketball simulation engine ranks the best players of all time. AKA ‚ÄúBasketball isn‚Äôt played on a spreadsheet!‚Äù (V3.0) (Reposting with mods‚Äô permission after making a change. This was the top post a couple of weeks ago but was removed and I‚Äôve updated the post accordingly) &gt;""Basketball isn't played on a spreadsheet!"" &gt;&gt;Well, what if it was? 2 years ago (during the 2023 offseason), I made a post breaking down how the basketball simulation website WhatIfSports values NBA players in a fictional league where every player in history is available, using a 5-year window of players‚Äô careers. &amp;nbsp; I posted an update not long ago, but a regular season of our biggest league just finished so I‚Äôm updating this with new findings and thoughts. &amp;nbsp; **The site:** WhatIfSports is a site that takes every season of every player ever, and lets you build team with those player seasons. It then runs their real-life advanced per-possession numbers through an engine to imagine what would happen with all players from your team + your opponents‚Äô teams on the court, and generates a new box score and stats (all the way down to every single possession and timeout) #Part 1 of the update: My original post got 532 comments. Let‚Äôs start this post with what I learned from those comments, and what I feel needs to be emphasized: *Role players*: this isn‚Äôt like a traditional best players of all-time ranking that typically measures who is the best at being ‚Äúthe guy.‚Äù We‚Äôre making complete teams and there‚Äôs only one basketball. Example: if you already have Steph Curry, Paul Pierce, James Worthy, and Patrick Ewing‚Ä¶then Chet Holmgren will help you out a LOT more than Paolo Banchero. Due to the makeup of an ALL-TIME PLAYER POOL, every team can easily have 8+ players who were great at being ‚Äúthe guy,‚Äù but there are only so many elite role players from NBA history to go around. Since this involves team building, and there‚Äôs an ABUNDANCE of high usage all-star wings in NBA history and only a limited amount of DPOY caliber players who are elite rebounders: the elite role players get a boost. Supply and demand. Yes it looks funny that Ben Wallace gets picked ahead of Kobe Bryant, but A) even though Ben is a low usage player, the things he‚Äôs good at are harder to come by, and B) you can get a good scoring SG like Alex English or Devin Booker with your last pick if you want, but the late round defensive centers aren‚Äôt nearly as good. The delta between Kobe and a 12th round scoring wing is less than between Ben Wallace and a 12th round role players center, which would be like‚Ä¶Oliver Miller. &amp;nbsp; *Normalization:* The game uses per-possession stats (AST%, USG%, etc), which does a pretty good job of normalizing by era/pace. &amp;nbsp; *Average players*: The ‚ÄúMendoza/Andy Dalton bar‚Äù is a lot higher: In a real world single season environment (real life), a replacement player is someone like Javonte Green. But when you‚Äôre putting EVERY player in history together, the replacement level guys are LaMelo Balls and Vlade Divacs. The 50th best guy in today‚Äôs NBA would be a borderline G-Leaguer if every player from history came through in a time machine. But guys who can rack up non-scoring stats without needing the ball will always have a home here. &amp;nbsp; *Pure stats:* The game doesn‚Äôt say ‚Äúwell ___ would have learned how to shoot 3s if they played today‚Äù. They added some imaginary 3s, blocks, and steals for players who played before the 3-point line/before those numbers were tracked, and honestly they‚Äôre pretty generous about it. But that‚Äôs it. This is just straight up stat comparison and in an environment where team building is the key. And players from 1994-97 who got to play with a shortened 3 point line benefit heavily since their stats are being compared to players who play with the normal 3-point line if anything. &amp;nbsp; *‚ÄúInvisible stats‚Äù:* TO%: This is huge for us and I NEVER see it brought up irl.

"In 2017, Dominic Cummings explained that Boris Johnson had always intended to ""absolutely no question about it"" deliver on the promise of ¬£350m a week to the NHS and that, if only he had been made leader, would have honoured the promises he made in the campaign. Here's the video (and transcript). This was at the Nudgestock 2017, a behavioural science conference hosted by Rory Sutherland, at which Dominic Cummings was a speaker. **Rory:** I mean, there is an ethical question about the bus. The promise to the NHS. Was that a promise you were really warranted to make? **Cummings**: So the issue about the bus and the NHS. One of the myths about that is that it was sort of... invented by us and we never had any intention of doing it. But what I thought would happen is that, if we won, Cameron would be finished and Osbourne would be finished and there would be a leadership campaign. I then thought that Boris was a shoe-in to win. But then, of course, \[...\] Boris didn't end up going in. But we had talked about this in private before the vote and actually on the day of victory in the Vote Leave office. So, when Boris came in on the Friday 24th and punched the air and whatnot, he and I walked into this little room amid, sort of, beer cans and craziness. And I said to him ""first thing you do is say '*we're going to meet this promise.'*"" and he smashed his fist down on the table and said '*absolutely, no question about it'.* And, if Boris had \[...\] run as leader, I am 99.9 recurr- I'm as sure as I can be about pretty much anything that Boris would have said '*I will honour the promises that we made in this campaign*.' Because him and Michael \[Gove\] were very aware of what they'd said, and they were aware of the dangers of being seen to go back on it. And also, they also had the view that um... what are the core problems of the Tory Party brand, going back decades? The NHS. And people think - by the way, and I think those people are right - '*the Tory Party is run by people who basically don't care about people like me*' right? That's what most people in the country have thought about the Tory Party for decades. I know a lot of Tory MPs, and I'm sad to say the public is basically correct. Tory MPs largely do not care about these poorer people. They don't care about the NHS. And the public kind of has cottoned on to that.

"Retreat, Hell - Episode 20 A/N: Hey, guys! It's been a long time, but I've finally finished the next episode! I had a few different things that have been providing distractions, but this episode was a LOT more painful to write than I was expecting. It's coming in at 14,034 words, which is a LOT longer than I was expecting for this episode when I first plotted it out. A number of things I wasn't planning on or plotting out/prepping for popped up, and some of it was quite a challenge. Writing a bunch of character exposition that you hadn't actually figured out yet, while making it consistent with everything else that's already happened, and everything else that you've planned to come in the future ... Well, that's not easy. A lot happens in this episode. There are some big developments, both character-wise, and overarching story-wise, and we learn a few details about a number of people in First Platoon. Episode 21 will be a jump to some new characters, some of whom might show up later in the story, some who might not. That episode is something I've been planning for a long time, and it's already mostly written. I've also got another visit to Tyriel and his misadventures coming in Episode 20.5.

Oh my goodness, it's something to watch. To watch him in the gym is a whole different thing. How much he makes everybody better, but also how he raises everybody‚Äôs level of play. His basketball IQ and his leadership ability. * Pelinka said that Jeanie Buss asked what the notable trait of this team is, and he said that it's their competitiveness, and that having a multitude of those guys has an exponentiation positive impact. * Rob Pelinka on the Lakers they‚Äôve been watching throughout the summer: ‚ÄúThis group of guys is as competitive as you can imagine ‚Ä¶ and Luke as the leader and coach is an ultra-competitive guy. He‚Äôs a fiery competitor. The gene of being a competitive individual is something that gets multiplied almost like compound interest when you have competitive guys in the gym."" * Magic says that he hasn't been this excited in a long time. Says they brought in guys who have won championships in LeBron, Rondo, &amp; McGee, which he says is what the young guys needed. Not just vets, but vets with that type of experience. Magic says LeBron is ""already in midseason form. You're sitting there thinking, man, glad we signed him."" * Magic: ‚ÄúRondo will help Lonzo go to another level...we got the right mentor.‚Äù * Pelinka noted how Magic, Rondo and Lonzo sat down to watch a Lakers-Pelicans game from last season. Rondo took them through what he was seeing on the court, and then Lonzo weighed in. Magic , ‚Äúthe best PG to play the game‚Äù oversaw it. * Magic says that whoever gets the rebound this year - they're gone. They want to run despite LeBron's history of playing on slower teams than how the Lakers played last year. But said it's ultimately up to Luke. ""We don't want his usage to be high. We're gonna run. We're not looking for one player."" - Magic on team's offensive identity with LeBron. Magic said that plenty of other players could initiate offense with the ball (mentions Rondo, Lonzo, Ingram). Magic is really empowering Luke in this press conference. Magic adds that Luke is already been scheming how to implement LeBron and the rest of the new guys. * Rob Pelinka: ""If you use a sports car analogy, we wanted this team to have a lot of engine thrust, and not just from one player. You can go down our list. We have playmakers and guys that can get it, and not just come at you, but come at you with force."" * Magic: ""We built this team off what we saw in the playoffs."" * Magic says they're ""very happy"" with the center position, feels like they have 2 guys at every position. Singles out JaVale's ability to block shots, and how they haven't had a guy like that here for a while. Notes his lob ability on pick &amp; rolls too. Pelinka notes that they don't even talk about ""center"" and ""point guard"" and positions like that anymore. They look at it through a positionless lens. Magic also named Beasley playing some five. Pelinka mentioned 7 or 8 guys are 6‚Äô8""-9‚Äù and above. * Magic Johnson said Kyle Kuzma got mad he was left off a top-100 list: ""I'm glad so he can keep working hard,"" Johnson said. Magic singles out KCP &amp; Kuzma as looking like ""totally different guys"" from a physical standpoint. * ROB IS TELLING A STORY: Rob Pelinka begins, ""I don't know if it's an ancient tale of old..."" and proceeds to compare Kuzma to a kitten running around the jungle, mimicking a lion, but not understanding what it means to be king of the jungle until seeing a real lion at work. LeBron is the lion. The point being that having champions around shows young guys how to be that for real, even if they thought that's what they were doing before.",Caregiver,Johnson & Johnson,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/9hjcgn/magic_johnson_and_rob_pelinka_press_conference/
"Today marks exactly 25 years since Wayne Greavette was killed in his house by a flashlight bomb. His murder is still unsolved. Disclaimer: If you're easily distressed, please *do not* listen to the 911 call below. It's seriously heartbreaking and bone-chilling in equal measures. **What happened that day?** Thursday, 12 December 1996, was a cold and rainy day in Moffat, a small hamlet outside Guelph, Ontario, Canada. 21-year-old Justin Greavette was on his way to fill up his truck when he checked the family's letterbox. There were some mails, and a package addressed to his father, [Wayne Greavette](https://imgur.com/a/eE5TlI0). Justin gave the package to Wayne when he returned home. Wayne opened the package. Inside were some newspaper flyers used as packing material, a letter, and a flashlight. Justin tried to turn on the flashlight as Wayne read the letter, but nothing happened. Justin then handed the flashlight to Wayne, who tried to turn it on while sitting on the sofa. This time, something did happen. When Wayne pressed the button, the flashlight [exploded](https://imgur.com/a/ku6tTWj) in his hands. Justin, who was sitting next to him, alongside Wayne's wife Diane, who was in the same room when the blast happened, were showered by shrapnels, but fortunately, both only suffered minor injuries. Justin immediately [called 911](https://youtu.be/15H1YJ4\_HkA?t=331), frantically telling the operator, ""There‚Äôs a bomb, and my dad just blew up!‚Äù By the time emergency services arrived at the Greavettes residence, there was little they could do to save Wayne‚Äôs life. He had died almost instantly. ----- **Who was Wayne Greavette?** 42-year-old Wayne Greavette had worked in the beverage packing industry for most of his life. He met his future wife, Diane, when they were 15. They got married when Diane was 17 and had two children, Danielle and Justin Greavette. At the time of his death, he and Diane were preparing to establish a spring water bottling facility in their sprawling Moffat farm. Wayne was mechanically gifted, and he took care of the facility's machinery while Diane worked on the logistics. ----- **The Evidence** This section will be divided into three parts, each talking about relevant evidence, in this case, namely the package box, the flashlight bomb, and the letter. **The Package** The package was wrapped in [wrapping paper](https://imgur.com/a/InI9PR9), white on the outside and hunter green on the inside. Inside was a box labelled [Domaine D‚Äôor Cabarnet](https://imgur.com/a/wPiQreh), which used to hold a bottle of red wine. At the top of the box, a rectangular hole had been neatly cut off. Investigators suspected that this was to remove the barcode and UPC which could be used to trace the wine to where it was purchased. Apart from the flashlight and the letter (which we'll get into in a moment), several flyers were used to pack the wine box. Most of these flyers were widely circulated in Southern Ontario. However, one stood out: a [flyer](https://imgur.com/a/zNQMzqj) advertising Copeland Lumber, a building centre located at [700 Main Street East, Milton](https://www.google.com/maps/place/700+Main+St+E,+Milton,+ON+L9T+3P6,+Canada/@43.5232805,-79.8737849,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x882b6f062d116fb5:0x2fc1b58b77f391fb!8m2!3d43.5232766!4d-79.8715962), around 20 km from Moffat (that address is now a Habitat for Humanity ReStore location) and was only distributed around the Milton area, which would suggest that the mailer might be local to the area.

Kyle Smith, Wall Street Journal - Mr. DeBlois‚Äôs film harks back to the pre-‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù style of children‚Äôs moviemaking, when the condescension of oversimplification was a defining attribute. Aparita Bhandari, Globe and Mail - Toothless glistens, thankfully. Young audiences will be delighted... For the older folks, there‚Äôs the added subtext of a post-war commentary, and the whole us-versus-them narrative to unpack, that‚Äôs ever more relevant today. Michael O'Sullivan, Washington Post - ‚ÄúDragon‚Äù imparts these pearls of wisdom with verve and delight, in a telling that is as visually impressive as it is emotionally stirring. **3/4** Brandon Yu, New York Times - To be sure, this new iteration is entertaining, bears a sense of heart and brings a tight script of fantasy and friendship to life. Soren Andersen, Seattle Times - It‚Äôs what the moviegoing experience should be about, but rarely is. Grand, glorious and fast on its feet. **4/4** Bob Mondello, NPR - Toothless is as charismatic as ever; the flying sequences and natural landscapes are appropriately breathtaking, and if the film is overly enamored of lesser dragons belching fire at incoherently bellowing Norsemen, well, so was the original. Matt Singer, ScreenCrush - Plays like cinematic d√©j√† vu. **5/10** Amy Nicholson, Los Angeles Times - How to train your dragon? As we learned back in 2010, it takes patience and fish. Why train your dragon again? That‚Äôs harder for filmmaker Dean DeBlois to answer. Peter Howell, Toronto Star - Is writer-director Dean DeBlois being consistent or just lazy? The question should keep him awake nights, staring at the dark sky in search of fresh dragons and wondering why he can‚Äôt do better than the cartoons he commanded earlier. **2/4** David Fear, Rolling Stone - What this movie is actually trying to accomplish, beyond a shadow of a doubt, is how to train their audiences to keep buying the same thing over, and over, and over again. Maureen Lee Lenker, Entertainment Weekly - In that regard, the film is every bit as earnest, captivating, and thrilling as its animated twin. And maybe that‚Äôs enough. **B** Michael Phillips, Chicago Tribune - The remake is just like the original, but there‚Äôs more of it.

"Intro to UK Race Riots Hey DGG, avid viewer from the UK here. Noticed some discussion in the X community and on here about what exactly is going on in the UK at the moment so I figured I would try to give as detailed and factually accurate appraisal for anyone looking for information. (Apologies for the formatting and spelling errors since this is being done on my phone) *Further Edit: I have been adding bits and pieces into this including sources and expanding on specific topics. While it would be great to add everything it‚Äôs just not possible so for any gaps in sources for stats or information my main recommendations would be the Gov.uk website for Government studies and findings, Migrant Observatory is run by the university of Oxford and is great at breaking down Government data sets and providing a research led approach to matters of immigration in the UK. Generally news sources are okay, the main ones to steer clear from are: The daily mail, The Sun and the Telegraph. The BBC is okay if you‚Äôre looking for breaking news and event timelines. The Basics: Here‚Äôs an article you can read as well summarising events: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/southport-stabbing-mosque-protests-riot-edl-b2588605.html These riots are an escalation from protests that started in the wake of a mass stabbing event in a town called Southport. It happened on Monday Morning. A 17 year old British Citizen: Axel Muganwa Rudakubana walked into a Taylor Swift themed dance class for children in Southport. He then began attacking the children and their parents with a knife. Stabbing multiple. He then fled the scene but was arrested by police later that day. As of now we know that multiple children were stabbed and so were two adults, 3 of the children have died while 5 others currently remain in critical condition. The two adults are also reported as being critically ill. While we now know the identity and background of the attacker, due to reporting laws in the UK until a judge had ruled to release his name, no one knew who he was at the time and no one could report on it. A couple of hours after the attack and in a vacuum of information, what were believed to be AI/Bot news accounts on X started publishing false information on the identity of the attacker. A quote from one of the accounts (@channel3now): ‚Äú17-year-old Ali Al-Shakati from Banks has been arrested in connection with the Southport stabbings and is currently in police custody. Ali-Al-Shakati, was on the MI6 watch list and known to Liverpool mental health services‚Ä¶ He was an asylum seeker who arrived in the UK by boat last year.‚Äù This report was then picked up by right wing online personalities and ‚Äúalternative media‚Äù journalists who hadn‚Äôt bothered to verify the validity of the claims or the reliability of the source (all of which had history of fabricating stories and facts for breaking news). Article on this: https://amp.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/jul/30/misinformation-southport-attack-suspect-social-media-conspiracy-theories Following this, the day after the attack (Tuesday 1st August) a vigil for the victims was held by the community while others from within the community and outside of it led a protest outside of a local mosque which then turned violent. At this point there were calls to action from right wing online personalities and political figures, mostly along the lines of stopping illegal migration and the migration of Muslims into the country. Again at this point the identity of the killer still wasn‚Äôt known and multiple far right groups arranged protests in multiple cities under the slogan: ‚ÄúEnough is enough‚Äù. On Thursday 4th August a judge ruled to release the Killer‚Äôs identity following a hearing on the grounds that since the killer was 18 in a few months and that this case was of significant public interest following the night of violence on Tuesday and the level of misinformation. The ruling revealed the name of the killer and we now know that he was ne",Caregiver,Johnson & Johnson,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/1ek4k1l/intro_to_uk_race_riots/
"[Star Wars Expanded Universe] A Tale of Two Clone Wars, or: The Original Star Wars ""Canon"" Crisis I love Star Wars and I always have. I decidedly *don't* love talking about Star Wars on the Internet, mostly because I find it a chore to keep straight which parts I'm *allowed* to love and which parts I'm *supposed* to hate. It's no way to enjoy something, of course, but such is the nature of ""being a fan"" in the 21st century. Nevertheless, the sad thing is that I can't seem to help but do it anyway, which is why I'm making this post (having threatened to do several times in various Hobby Scuffle threads) in which I have written five and a half thousand words about decade-old Star Wars fan drama that many people may have forgotten about, if they even knew it existed in the first place. But maybe you will enjoy reading about it. **A Long Time Ago...** This is a story about the Star Wars Expanded Universe. I anticipate that most of the folks reading this will know what that was: the great mass of novels, comics, games, cartoons and more which took place in the fictional world of Star Wars, revealing ""what happened next"" for the protagonists of the movies, exploring its ancient history (a dark time in which the Jedi are hunted by the resurgent Sith Empire) and far(ish) future (a dark time in which the Jedi are hunted by the resurgent Sith Empire) and explaining how the extra with the ice cream machine who appears on screen for about three seconds in *The Empire Strike Back* was *actually* a Rebel sympathiser and the ice cream machine was *actually* a computer memory core containing sensitive information which he was trying to hide before the Empire could completely take over Cloud City. When George Lucas sold Lucasfilm and Star Wars with it to the Walt Disney Company, the Expanded Universe found itsef in limbo for a couple of years until Disney confirmed that all Star Wars stories produced prior to its acquisition other than the six movies and the *Clone Wars* computer-animated series (in other words, the things in which George Lucas himself had taken an active and direct hand in creating, writing, producing and directing) would be rebranded as ""Legends"" and would not form part of the larger fictional story of Star Wars going forward. My recollection is that most fans were more disappointed than angry. Of course, some people absolutely *were* angry, some of them very, very, *very* angry, and many of those angry folks are *still* angry today, but I imagine most people had realised that this was an inevitable outcome from the moment the sale and acquisition was announced. The Expanded Universe was now ""non-canon"". However, I think the picture is a little more complex than that. I'm going to try to explain why. **Star Wars and ""canon""** Oh, good grief. What a can of worms. This is a really easy topic to get bogged down in and its almost certainly going to happen here, but I think it's pretty important to the overall story, so I'll wade through it. My understanding has always been that ""canon"" in Star Wars prior to the sale of Lucasfilm to Disney vaguely operated on a kind of tiered system. At the highest level, you had ""G"" canon, which was anything George Lucas himself had taken an active and direct hand in creating, writing, producing and directing. This encompassed the movies, obviously, but also ~~flippant off-the-cuff remarks~~ ex cathedra pronouncements such as Obi-Wan's home planet being called ""**Stewjon**"", which Lucas ""revealed"" in an incredibly obvious dad joke when he was asked during an interview with **Jon Stew**art at a convention in 2010 (for the record, this is still ""canon"" - we shall see if it comes up in the Disney Plus series soon enough). The lower levels of ""canon"" encompassed essentially everything that was licensed; in other words, everything Star Wars that George Lucas had no input on. This material was counted as ""canon"" to the extent that it did not contradict anything at the George Lucas level and, in some c",Caregiver,Johnson & Johnson,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/up16zw/star_wars_expanded_universe_a_tale_of_two_clone/

"Speed reviews of my 58 samples order! **Arabian Oud - Madawi** It's very intense, way too heavy, too strong. Smells like a luxury department store in Dubai where they sprayed too much perfume. After I tested it, I found out that Sofia Vergara uses this one, and I can see that! She's a super strong presence, immaculately dressed, superior human. I, on the other hand, am a little work-from-home goblin, whose daily battles are ""does tomato sauce leave a permanent stain?"" and ""is it too late to start watching Game of Thrones?"". So, I'll pass on this one. **Boyfriend's opinion:** Damn, so intense. Heavy. **Final Score:** 2 / 5 **Armani Prive - Th√© Yulong** So I bought the full bottle already. Zero self-control. It's such a relaxing, fresh, aromatic, citrusy tea. This is one I can totally see expensive luxury spas using. Or fancy boutique hotels. As you read through these reviews, you'll discover my life's mission is to smell like an overpriced establishment. Th√© Yulong gets me closer to that goal. It also lasts decently on my skin and clothes. **Boyfriend's opinion:** ""Mmmm what's in this, lemon? Orange? This is so nice, I like it a lot."" Since I bought the full bottle, he's actually been requesting ""the one that looks like a butt plug"" because he loves the smell so much ü•π **Final Score:** 5 / 5 **Armani Prive - Vert Malachite** Smooth, slightly sweet, creamy white floral with a touch of vanilla. It's very floral and delicate, ultra-feminine. It's not really for me‚ÄîI do wish the bitter orange came through more. Then I think it might be a contender for me. You really don‚Äôt need much of this; I imagine it will get too much if over-sprayed. Performance is great on this, so a bottle will last a long time. **Final Score: 3.8 / 5** **Armani Prive - Noir Kogane** This smells like a leathery ashtray and it stays in your nose for eternity like a clingy ex. That's it, that's the review. **Boyfriend's opinion:** ""It really does smell like an ashtray."" Validation üòå **Final Score:** 1 / 5 **Byredo - Gypsy Water** It's very chic clean girl. At first it's citrus, sandalwoody, aromatic. Out of all the Byredo's I tried, this one has the worst performance on me. On dry down it becomes a slightly sweetened vanilla skin scent. Overall cute, but nothing more. Not worth the weak performance or getting a full bottle. There are other Byredo perfumes I much prefer to this. **Final Score: 3.5 / 5** **Byredo - Bal d'Afrique** Immediately yes. Love at first smell. This is really my taste. Aromatic, woody citrus perfection. Woody, floral, fresh, citrus, aromatic, this perfume could cater to lovers of all of these. It smells expensive, like a luxurious spa. I always look for a spa scent, just like I always look for more tea scents. To me, it's unique. Very bright, the wood grounds it and I LOVE that there is a touch of musk in here. I love that it smells natural. It really smells like you just got out of a very expensive hotel shower. It's year-round in my opinion, signature-worthy. The lasting power was also decent! I could wear this all the time. **Boyfriend's opinion:** Lovely!! **Final Score: 5 / 5** **Byredo - Mojave Ghost** Something about this reminds me of skincare or fancy shampoo, in a good way. I think it deserves the hype. It has a fresh airy quality, but the sapodilla fruit used in it makes it a bit more interesting. I think Bal d'Afrique is overall better, but I go back and forth between them. This is another fresh out the shower type of perfume, but in a more girly and fruity floral way. I wish it had better longevity on me, but maybe with a proper sprayer on clothes, it would suffice. **Boyfriend's opinion:** Also lovely!! I think I prefer this one over Bal d'Afrique, but they're both amazing. **Final Score: 4 / 5** **Byredo - Mojave Ghost Absolu** This one is expectedly an enhanced version of the OG. Performance is great! Somewhat musky, some woodiness and floral.

"Compelling case on why all 30 NBA franchises should move cities Sure, some team names make perfect sense for their location (Pistons, Hornets, Nuggets, Celtics), while some team names require a historian to explain (Lakers, Jazz, Grizzlies). And then some teams are just lame weather reports (Heat, Suns, Thunder), while others are entertainment industry advertisements (Magic, Raptors, 76ers). And then there are all dum animal names that are completely interchangeable. The point is each franchise has to move and not just swap names but take their entire organization with them, players and all. Judging criteria is simple: * Clearly a better fitting name for the city. * Should be inspirational for what the city wants to be perceived as. * Or, let‚Äôs be honest, most of these will not make any sense at all. I‚Äôm just chasing a perfect loop here. Let‚Äôs start this one off with 2020 Champs: Lakers! - **LAKERS**. Sure, it would make sense to send this team back to Minnesota where they have more lakes than black people, but there is another place where ‚Äúlake‚Äù is literally in their official city motto. ‚ÄúMistake by the Lake‚Äù **CLEVELAND LAKERS**(sorry Bron) - **CAVALIERS**. This team name is a weird reference to a bunch of US presidents being born in Ohio. But when we think of Ohio, do we think of failed rust belt cities, unemployment and poverty, urban decay, opioid crisis, or do we think of the POTUS? Come on! **WASHINGTON CAVALIERS** - **WIZARDS**. The whole nerd lore of wizards and spells and trolls and magic is of European origin dating back to illiterate medieval surfs being afraid of wooded areas. Make up your own fables US! New Orleans voodoo? Now that‚Äôs some proper spicy home brewed shit! **NEW ORLEANS WIZARDS** - **PELICANS**. Sure, that‚Äôs Louisiana‚Äôs state bird, but these flying rodents are all over the gulf region. And some of the Louisiana ones are brown but lots of them are white as toilet paper. That‚Äôs not very NBA. You have to go east to find the true urban pelicans-of-color: **MIAMI PELICANS** - **HEAT** Vikings intentionally swapped names of Greenland and Iceland in a brilliant real estate marketing ploy. It didn‚Äôt work out of course, but maybe it worked on just enough ‚Äòright‚Äô people. Toronto doesn‚Äôt need to fool all players into thinking Toronto is not literally located on the north pole. Just enough of them to fill a roster that is not an all-scrubs-team. Also Toronto actually does have really beautiful summers. All 6 weeks of them! **TORONTO HEAT** - **RAPTORS**. Dinosaurs have always been a major point of contention for all western religions. Their existence really spoil the plot of ‚ÄúTHE GOD‚Äù S1E 1. When Mormons ended up settling in what is now modern day Utah, they ended up in a region with one of the richest fossil deposits in the world. Look to the ground and dinosaur bones everywhere! So, what is LDS Church‚Äôs take on dinos? ‚ÄúUhh it is not important that they existed or not uhh like, that‚Äôs not the main plotline anyways, can we talk about something else?‚Äù lol **UTAH RAPTORS** - **JAZZ** Jazz originates in New Orleans, no doubt about that one. But! Jazz is such a quintessential American style of music that spread like wildfire across the nation. LA-Chicago-NYC. Truly the original hip hop where you didn‚Äôt need no words to cuss at the world. But it was Chicago Daily Tribune who first ever coined the word Jazz back in 1915. Also, best Jazz I have personally seen was in Chicago. Makes all other Jazz sound like Drake. **CHICAGO JAZZ** - **BULLS** If I was literally a bull, I would probably move to Wall Street NY where they already have a statue of me. Or just maybe, move to a place that has a lot of cows. Apparently Texas has 11 million cows. That is more cows than human population of 43 individual US states.

"Anybody else feeling incredibly vindicated right now? The Acolyte bombed. Outlaws is looking like a failure. The Rey show is MIA. Rian Johnson‚Äôs trilogy is MIA. Almost everything in modern Star Wars is a failure. Years and years of being told, as a fan, that the franchise was no longer for me, that my criticisms stemmed from racism/sexism, that I was a bigot, a phobe, a Nazi. My criticisms were never about women in Star Wars. It just so happens that most of the women in Disney Star Wars are poorly written, and I‚Äôd address the same criticisms at the male characters they fucked up too. Luke, Obi Wan, Darth Vader, Boba Fett?? All destroyed. All I‚Äôve been saying, since the word go, is that I want the characters to be treated with respect, to have obstacles, to show some actual fucking growth, a reason to be invested. Apparently that makes me every nasty thing under the sun. Because Disney‚Äôs tried so hard to push women, when they can‚Äôt write women that are appealing to anybody, except the women who write them. Well, to those who pushed to have Star Wars the way it is now; how‚Äôs that going for you? To be inundated with mediocre product after mediocre product. Flop after flop after flop.

"How Ukraine has been made the anvil on which a new era wiil be forged. Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine could be described as a watershed moment in modern history, a turning point comparable in importance to the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, and even to the outbreak and resulting international reshuffle of WW2. Whether this ominous view of the war turns out to be justified, only time, and future historians, will tell. But there‚Äôs no doubt that in the violent, tumultuous days after February 24th, the established international order has been shaken and, in some respects, upended in extraordinary, unexpected and often unwelcome ways. And quite possibly purposefully so. It was not very long before this war, that the nations of Russia and China put out quite an interesting [statement](https://china.usc.edu/russia-china-joint-statement-international-relations-february-4-2022) *just three weeks before the invasion,* about a new cooperation towards the goal of creating a ""new era"" in the world, a new order dominated not by western hegemony but by themselves. A full breakdown of that statement can be found [here.](https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2022/02/12/breaking-down-that-putin-xi-joint-statement-on-a-new-era/) Three weeks? The statement was made February 4th 2022, and the invasion of Ukraine began on the 24th, not even three weeks later. Coincidence? Happenstance? I think not. The conflict in Ukraine will become the catalyst of a new world order, a trigger for radical upheaval. It has created a bombshell on the world stage that could create a new global geopolitical battle, and result in a much-altered future for us all. In trying to find meaning behind the sudden press of Vladimir Putin's drive for Ukraine, most people are coming up empty in the ""why"" column. There are, of course, plenty of reasons stated in the propaganda of both sides, some of which sound pretty good, but all of them fail when one looks at the bigger picture. Because they all assume this is about Ukraine, and only about Ukraine. Nato encroachment, the defence of russian-speaking people, desires to reclaim ancestral lands, fears of being cut off, all of these sound okay. Sorta. But the reality is that none of those reasons are worth the consequences of what we have been seeing unfold. Anyone here ever play Monopoly? What is the least fun position? It is that of the player who, early in the game, realizes that he is already doomed. The dice did not go in his favor one too many times, and he knows that, as the board stands, he has no chance of winning at all. It happens, and the other players still have lots of fun, because they are still really competing with each other, while the loser grows bored and upset. The operative phrase in that statement is ""as the board stands."" But what if there was an accident? Oh no! I spilled my dinner plate across the board! The dog just jumped on everything! That guy got his peanut butter all over my chocolate! Now what? Dang, looks like we all have to start over. And that losing player, well, now he is back in the game. A very simplified analogy, but relevant. Because I believe that this entire thing has very little to do with taking over Ukraine, a very large nation which Russia knows it would be very hard pressed to occupy and govern permanently. What I think is that this is just an opening gambit in a much larger operation to destabilize the western hegemony, send the global economy into a crisis, and rewrite the global security architecture away from the currently imposed system of rules-based order and closer to the way things were when wars of conquest were more common. When might made right. A coordinated campaign to bring the world into a state of chaos and war, crashing economies, disrupting food supplies, hampering trade, and in general making a huge mess that can only be cleaned up one way... Upsetting the game board, as it were, helps put everyone closer to a level playing field again. Russia was never going to win.

"WWE is going to want to crush All In and ROH, their plotting started today &amp; Bullet Club brand has outgrown both ROH and New Japan - Mike Johnson OPINION PIECE. Full Article: https://www.pwinsider.com/article/117454/all-in-now-what-thoughts-on-the-biggest-independent-moment-in-pro-wrestling-in-years-and-what-it-means-going-forward.html?p=1 &gt;BULLET CLUB THE BRAND HAS OUTGROWN ROH AND NEW JAPAN &gt;The ‚ÄúAll In‚Äù show was not built nor was it promoted as a Ring of Honor event, although the story is that ROH is providing an infrastructure and assistance. With Rhodes and The Bucks signed to ROH (as well as other talents who are on ‚ÄúAll In‚Äù being signed to appear), it doesn‚Äôt take a genius to guess that ROH has a vested interest in the show, or else they wouldn‚Äôt allow their talents to be doing a show on their own at this level. How much of that interest exists, however, will likely not ever get revealed‚Ä¶at least, not anytime soon. &gt;Bullet Club, through the nature of its origins as an anti-hero, renegade group has marched to its own drum since its inception. That personality was what sold the group, but over time, the wrestling became secondary and the personalities involved sold the group ‚Äì and made it so popular that Hot Topic came to them about carrying shirts nationally. You can debate how much Bullet Club means to the average pro wrestling fan, but if you are a discerning one who watches more than the WWE Network, they move the needle for you. &gt;What is both amazing and scary all at once is that Bullet Club has morphed into the modern-day equivalent of what the NWO used to be for World Championship Wrestling ‚Äì the company asset that has grown so large and so hot, it‚Äôs at the point of outshining the mothership. Remember when Scott Hall used to do the survey and ask who the fans were here to see, and most nights, the villainous NWO was more over? That‚Äôs Bullet Club today. &gt;Bullet Club has grown so hot, but at the same time, have become so embedded in the ROH DNA, that by the week, they become all that more important to the long-term viability of ROH. While certainly the company could hire other talents, the loss of this crop would lead to the company losing so much ground and goodwill at once, it‚Äôs impossible to measure. &gt;After all, Cody and the Bucks just became the top independent draws in all professional wrestling ‚Äì with the gate receipts to prove it. Certainly, there are others involved here who helped move tickets, including Kenny Omega, but the stamp of the show was Bullet Club as seen through the prism of that trio. Cody left WWE because he didn‚Äôt want to be a supporting player in their stories. The Bucks have pushed their independence and developed themselves as new school heels who put their thumb in the eye of every wrestling convention and tradition. Their latest accomplishment not only lifted them all to the next level, but it pushed them beyond the box that is ROH. &gt;ROH drew a thousand or so in Chicago tonight. All In sold 10,000 tickets without the traditional ROH branding. The show also sold double the amount of tickets New Japan has moved thus far during their recent American excursions. Those companies are seen as corporations, as companies. Bullet Club are seen as the cool garage band you love to support, only now they are making money without selling out to the man. &gt;""All In"", its presentation and it's success rests on the marketing and creative building the show, which lands on the shoulders of several talents who collectively, on this date, mean more than the promotions they are contracted to.

True magic, however, can‚Äôt be recycled. - Owen Gleiberman, Variety Even during its more successful moments, Wish‚Äôs magic falls flat. The film is weighed down by its purpose: to revel in Disney nostalgia while soaring into the future. - Lovia Gyarkye, Hollywood Reporter ‚ÄúWish‚Äù entertains and unabashedly owns being a safe paean to old-school Disney, shamelessly aiming for all your nostalgic feels. **3/4** \- Brian Truitt, USA Today Part of the problem here is Disney‚Äôs fixation with old-fashioned stories of kings and castles and princesses. **1/4** \- G. Allen Johnson, San Francisco Chronicle What saves the film from being nothing but a rehash are DeBose, whose singing voice unsurprisingly shines, and Pine (who sang in ‚ÄúInto the Woods‚Äù), who makes an excellent villain, as well as some of the songs, most of which they‚Äôre involved in. **3/5** \- Bill Goodykoontz, Arizona Republic Wish is a disappointment. What could have been a beautiful celebration of Disney‚Äôs past ends up being one big poorly designed Easter egg hunt. The heart is in the right place, but the pieces never add up to something more. **2/5** \- Jenny Nulf, Austin Chronicle Tunes are generously sprinkled throughout the film, perhaps directors Chris Buck and Fawn Veerasunthorn‚Äôs way of acknowledging that their film works best when the characters are singing through their problems instead of unimaginatively talking... - Barry Hertz, Globe and Mail Wish, clearly, has been made with care, but as its credits offer a whistle-stop tour through Disney‚Äôs history, it‚Äôs hard not to think ‚Äì god, wasn‚Äôt it great when they made stuff as weird and fun and daring as, say, The Emperor‚Äôs New Groove? **3/5** \- Clarisse Loughrey, Independent (UK) \[It\] feels like an attempt, after a wobbly decade, to return the brand to first principles. Unfortunately, it turns out to be a self-portrait of an altogether less flattering type ‚Äì a sort of Corporate Identity Crisis: The Movie. **2/5** \- Robbie Collin, Daily Telegraph (UK) Wish is a strained animated musical which overtly references the company‚Äôs most beloved films, a strategy that mostly exposes how singular the studio‚Äôs productions used to be. - Tim Grierson, Screen International As Disney celebrates its 100th year, ‚ÄúWish‚Äù serves as a throwback to the past, a celebration of the present, and a gentle push into the future. **B-** \- Kate Erbland, indieWire Ariana DeBose belts out a few good tunes, but this supposed centennial celebration falls flat. **5/10** \- Jordan Hoffman, The Messenger **SYNOPSIS:** In ‚ÄúWish,‚Äù Asha, a sharp-witted idealist, makes a wish so powerful that it is answered by a cosmic force‚Äîa little ball of boundless energy called Star.

But not because it‚Äôs too convoluted to follow. It‚Äôs because the real convolution is: Why are we supposed to care? About any of this? - Owen Gleiberman, Variety At one point in the film, Godzilla, weary from all that stomping around, lies down to take a well-deserved nap in the middle of Rome‚Äôs Colosseum. It‚Äôs the most relatable moment in the film. - Frank Scheck, Hollywood Reporter When Godzilla x‚Äôes Kong ‚Äî whatever the hell that means ‚Äî everybody wins. - William Bibbiani, TheWrap Being in Hollow Earth takes some of the fun out of things... That also leaves Godzilla x Kong residing in a purely CGI arena without even tenuous connections to reality. It's a empty chamber for movie spectacle and nothing else. **2/4** \- Jake Coyle, Associated Press When you multiply Godzilla by Kong, what do you get? When Wingard‚Äôs doing the math, it‚Äôs an earnest, wacky, hectic ride that often feels like being thrashed about in an Imax seat. **2/4** \- Katie Walsh, Tribune News Service Wingard‚Äôs not a sentimentalist, and ‚ÄúGodzilla x Kong‚Äù stumbles whenever he tries to slap phony emotions onto the film to make it more like a generic crowd-pleaser. He‚Äôs a showman, a popcorn guy with excellent aesthetics. **2.5/4** \- Amy Nicholson, Washington Post ‚ÄúGodzilla x Kong: The New Empire‚Äù has very little road left to cruise, and it shows. - Alissa Wilkinson, New York Times ""X‚Äù is also the symbol that should have been prodigiously used to cross out the script‚Äôs many, many stupid ideas. **2/4** \- Johnny Oleksinski, New York Post I guess, if you‚Äôre wowed by soulless CGI chaos. Thrilling? Not really. At the end, I was left feeling the way Kong does at the beginning: tired and bored. - Kyle Smith, Wall Street Journal ‚ÄúGodzilla x Kong‚Äù is exactly as you‚Äôd expect it to be: a popcorn movie with special effects that are better imagined than Marvel movies, rip-roarin‚Äô action and monsters, monsters, monsters. It does its job. **2.5/4** \- G. Allen Johnson, San Francisco Chronicle Despite the addition of some new characters (human and otherwise), ‚ÄúKong x Godzilla: The New Empire‚Äù comes across as a relatively uninspired and repetitive effort and a fairly forgettable chapter in the Monsterverse saga. **2/4** \- Richard Roeper, Chicago Sun-Times ‚ÄúGodzilla X Kong‚Äù makes up for its own deficiencies with oddball flourishes. Wingard and the writers work like rogue chefs at an Olive Garden, tossing everything they can at any number of walls to see what sticks. **3/4** \- Michael Phillips, Chicago Tribune The problem with ‚ÄúGodzilla x Kong: The New Empire‚Äù is the same as so many of these franchise-based films: They‚Äôre all soulless special-effects extravaganzas where CGI takes the place of character development, good writing, and emotional connection. **1.5/5** \- Odie Henderson, Boston Globe ""Godzilla x Kong"" is as big and loud as expected, but when the dust is settled, there's nothing to hold onto. The kaiju clash is a crushing bore. **C-** \- Adam Graham, Detroit News Look, with that pairing, you know what you‚Äôre going to get. And in this picture you get it. And get it.

"[OC] How a a basketball simulation engine ranks the best players of all time. AKA ‚ÄúBasketball isn‚Äôt played on a spreadsheet!‚Äù (UPDATED for 24-25) *""Basketball isn't played on a spreadsheet!"" Well, what if it was?* &amp;nbsp; 2 years ago, I made a Reddit post where I broke down how the basketball simulation website WhatIfSports values NBA players in a **fictional league** where **every player from history is available**, in a league that uses a 5-year window of a player‚Äôs career where new games are simulated. A brief explanation of WhatIfSports is that it takes every season of every player ever, and lets you build team with those player seasons. It then runs their real-life advanced per-possession numbers through an engine to imagine what would happen with all players from your team + your opponents‚Äô teams on the court, and generates a new box score and stats (all the way down to every single possession and timeout) &amp;nbsp; My original post 2 years ago got 532 comments. Some of them had good points and thoughts, so let‚Äôs start this post with what I learned from those comments, and what I feel needs to be explained better this time: - The biggest disconnect from the original post‚Äôs comments seems to be that people didn‚Äôt understand that this isn‚Äôt like a traditional best players of all-time ranking that typically measures who is the best at being ‚Äúthe guy.‚Äù We‚Äôre making complete teams and there‚Äôs only one basketball. Due to the makeup of an ALL-TIME PLAYER POOL, every team can easily have 8+ players who were great at being ‚Äúthe guy,‚Äù but there are only so many elite role players from NBA history to go around. Since this involves team building, and there are an absolute ABUNDANCE of high usage all-star wings in NBA history, but only a limited amount of DPOY caliber players who are elite rebounders: the elite role players get a boost to their stock. Simple supply and demand. Yes it looks funny that Ben Wallace gets picked ahead of Kobe Bryant, but A) even though Ben is a low usage player, the things he‚Äôs good at are harder to come by, and B) you can get a good scoring SG like Alex English or Devin Booker with your last pick if you want, but the late round defensive centers aren‚Äôt nearly as good. The delta between Kobe and a 12th round scoring wing is less than between Ben Wallace and a 12th round role players center, which would be like‚Ä¶Oliver Miller. Again, supply and demand. - The game uses per-possession stats (AST%, USG%, etc), which does a pretty good job of normalizing by era/pace. I explained this in the last post but I really want to emphasize it again. - In this world, guys who are real life all-stars by being slightly above average for a high amount of minutes aren‚Äôt as valuable as they would be in real life. With 12 draft picks and only needing to fill 48 minutes for 5 positions, you‚Äôre better off platooning two great low-minute guys like Manu Ginobili plus Jimmy Butler together (Butler plays less minutes per season than you‚Äôd realize) than you would be with a high minute borderline all-star like DeMar DeRozan alone, since Manu and Butler both have far better per-possession stats. (Also, a player being slightly above average in a normal NBA season would be below average in a world that includes every player ever. The 50th best guy in today‚Äôs NBA would be a borderline G-Leaguer if every player from history came through in a time machine). - The game doesn‚Äôt say ‚Äúwell ___ would have learned how to shoot 3s if they played today‚Äù like humans say.

"A New Fan's Guide to the NBA 2018-2019 Season Almost a year ago to the day, today, I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/71q7j5/brand_new_to_basketball_whats_happening_right_now/) on r/nba explaining that I was a new fan who‚Äôd just moved from a non-basketball city (Pittsburgh) to a basketball city (Portland) trying to catch up on the league. I asked for some help understanding the state of the NBA: the storylines, the teams to watch, the players to pay attention to. You guys gave me a ton of amazing, wonderful responses. So this year, after following the league closely, reading NBA books, watching NBA documentaries, and having this sub as my homepage for the past year ‚Äì I wanted to repay you. So may I present... ##**A New Fan‚Äôs Guide to the NBA 2018-2019 Season.** I hope this is helpful in assisting any new fans to basketball, or to the NBA, or any fans returning after not paying attention for a few seasons. Enjoy! *** **1. NBA Basketball 101** **2. Positions &amp; Player Types** **3. A Brief History of the NBA** **4. Team-by-Team Breakdowns** *** #**1. NBA Basketball 101** **Scoring ‚ÄòBaskets‚Äô.** Putting the ball through the hoop either awards you 1, 2, or 3 points depending on the circumstance. 2-point shots are the most common, and the default for any shot, lay-up, or dunk. The shot is worth 3-points if it enters the basket from beyond the aptly-named 3-point line, also called ‚Äòthe arc‚Äô (e.g. ‚Äòfrom beyond the arc‚Äô or ‚Äòfrom downtown‚Äô). Common types of standard shots include the ‚Äòjump shot‚Äô, when a player‚Äôs feet leave the ground as the ball leaves his hands, and the ‚Äòstep back‚Äô, when a player quickly steps backwards, away from the defender just before shooting. The only 1-point baskets are free throws ‚Äì open, uncontested shots awarded to players who have been fouled, or whose team has amassed a certain number of fouls in a quarter. **Fouls &amp; Violations.** The penalties of the NBA come in a wide variety of obscure forms, but the ones you‚Äôre going to see the most are: ‚Ä¢ Personal Fouls ‚Äì When an opposing player hits, pushes, shoves, holds, or illegally obstructs another player. If the fouled player was shooting the ball, and the ball went in, they‚Äôre awarded one free throw (i.e. they get 2 points for the basket, or 3 if it was a 3-pointer, and have an opportunity to make it a 3-point or 4-point play, respectively, by scoring a free-throw). If the fouled player was shooting the ball while fouled and missed, they are awarded either 2 free throws for a missed 2-pointer, or 3 free throws for a missed 3-pointer. ‚Ä¢ Charging ‚Äì You can‚Äôt plow into a defending player. ‚Ä¢ Blocking ‚Äì You can‚Äôt plow into an offensive player. ‚Ä¢ Traveling ‚Äì You can‚Äôt move while holding the ball and not dribbling it. ‚Ä¢ Carrying ‚Äì You can‚Äôt hold the ball from underneath between dribbles. ‚Ä¢ Goaltending ‚Äì Imagine a shot ball as traveling in an arc through the air. Once it reaches the apex of that arc and begins to fall downward toward the basket, it can no longer be blocked, or touched, by any player. ‚Ä¢ 3-Second Violation ‚Äì In general, you cannot stand in the ‚Äòkey‚Äô or ‚Äòlane‚Äô ‚Äì the painted rectangle just under the basket ‚Äì for more than 3 seconds. There are a variety of exceptions, but in general this prevents a player from standing under the basket for a substantial period of time. There are others that are less common and less important. Understand that many of these fouls and violations are, to some degree, subjective, and that the referees who determine whether they‚Äôve taken place are imperfect. Mistakes are made. Calls are made that shouldn‚Äôt have been, and calls aren‚Äôt made that should‚Äôve been. It‚Äôs part of the game. Get used to it. **Assists.** Assists are a stat awarded to players who pass the ball to a player who then promptly scores. This stat reflects a player‚Äôs passing ability, their unselfishness, and their ‚Äòvision‚Äô ‚Äì their ability to know where other players are on the court and to get the ball to them at the right time to guaran",Caregiver,Johnson & Johnson,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/9jzdij/a_new_fans_guide_to_the_nba_20182019_season/

"Official r/NFL Week 7 Power Rankings Welcome to the week 7 Official r/NFL Power Rankings! [In an almost historic week of lopsided victories](https://youtu.be/s6RkBL_99fI), the NFL saw a Mahomes-esque regression to the mean after a spoiled first quarter season of close games. Are the Lions tougher than their record? Have the Bengals finally done enough? Will the Falcons ever play a decent team? Discuss!

This organization has bullied the Texans enough. Controversial opinion, but go ‚ÄòStros! Time to prepare for *another* big test in Green Bay on Thursday night. 2. | [](/TB) | Buccaneers | -- | 6-1 | If Brady kryptonite Nick Foles had started, it may have led to a different outcome, but the Bucs picked up an overwhelmingly one-sided 38-3 victory over the Chicago Bears. Though Brady threw for 4 TD's, the defense was the real star of the show, notching 4 sacks, 3 forced fumbles (with 3 recoveries), and an additional 3 INT's. The takeaways for the defense should serve as a fine practice for next week's matchup against the New Orleans Saints, where Jameis is likely to use the Bucs' DB's as an extra set of WR's. 3. | [](/LAR) | Rams | -1 | 6-1 | Unlike Jared Goff, this win was ugly. The Lions wanted to win bigly and got off to a hot start, emptying out the bag of tricks early in the form of fake punts and an onside kick. Slow starts to both halves from the Rams kept the score close until the 4th quarter when they finally pulled away. Despite a decent looking box score, the Rams never really felt right: they were unprepared on special teams and failed the eye test defensively at times (yet again). So far, a porous looking defense hasn‚Äôt been a big storyline with the focus on the magic between Stafford and Kupp. Maybe it‚Äôs high expectations or finding things to nitpick about a 6-1 team, but there‚Äôs a small sense that despite solid defensive metrics on paper, this will be an issue at some point unless buttoned down. Derrick Henry in week 9 looms large. Until then, the Rams are massive favorites against Houston next week. 4. | [](/BUF) | Bills | +1 | 4-2 | [The Bills checking up on the AFC after their bye week like](https://gfycat.com/faroffcarelessjackal) 5. | [](/DAL) | Cowboys | +2 | 5-1 | Collins is back from suspension, five IR/PUP guys are in their practice windows, and Dak seems to be good to go for Sunday night. As good as this team has been so far, they weren't even at full strength. Things are looking up. 6. | [](/GB) | Packers | -- | 6-1 | The defense finally got a red zone stop! The Packers limited Washington to 3 points in four red zone trips! De'Vondre Campbell is really flashing the proverbial leather here, Even with allowing Taylor Heinicke to run wild they kept the points off the board. Sure we might get obliterated by the Cardinals in two days, but hey Aaron's done more with less in Arizona before 7. | [](/CIN) | Bengals | **+5** | 5-2 | All is good in Bengals world right now. The Joe Burrow to Ja'Marr Chase connection looks unstoppable and the rebuilt Bengals defense was able to beat the Ravens for the first time in the Lamar Jackson era. The only thing between the Bengals and a 6-2 record right now is a visit with their old friend Joe Flacco. 8. | [](/TEN) | Titans | +1 | 5-2 | The Titans seemed to have great execution on their game plan going in the first half of the week 7 game against the Chiefs. At halftime the Titans held a 27-0 lead, held the ball for 23:16 and ended every drive with a score. The Chiefs were held to 5 drives in the first half ending in 2 turnovers, 2 punts and the end of the half.

"Religion Was Never Out of U.S. Politics. Trump Just Took Off the Mask. Theocracy doesn‚Äôt need a declaration, just enough loopholes and someone ruthless enough to use them. Trump didn‚Äôt invent theocracy in America, but he ruthlessly exploited centuries-old religious loopholes to build a system where loyalty to him and to religious ideology now overrides law and democratic norms. Let‚Äôs start with education. For well over a century, American public funds have bled into religious education, from Bible-led ‚Äúcommon schools‚Äù in the 1800s to modern-day voucher systems. But landmark Supreme Court rulings like Carson v. Makin and Espinoza v. Montana made it explicit: states can‚Äôt exclude religious schools from taxpayer-funded voucher programs. What did Trump do? He supercharged this by championing school choice, funnelling billions into religious schools with no requirement for secular curriculum, no accountability for science standards, civic education, or civil rights protections. Why it matters: This isn‚Äôt just about money. It builds a loyal, ideologically aligned base, generation after generation, educated under religious nationalism and isolated from democratic values. ‚Äî Then there‚Äôs the Johnson Amendment, which once barred churches from endorsing candidates. In 2017, Trump signed an executive order telling the IRS to stop enforcing it. Why it matters: Now, pastors and religious leaders can openly campaign for Trump from the pulpit, and still keep their tax-exempt status. He transformed churches into campaign arms, immune from regulation and fueled by congregants‚Äô trust. ‚Äî Through RFRA (Religious Freedom Restoration Act), Trump expanded religious exemptions in federally funded services: adoption agencies, hospitals, welfare programs. Faith-based groups could now legally deny services to LGBTQ+ people, non-Christians, and the non-religious. Why it matters: These aren‚Äôt private charities, they‚Äôre publicly funded. But now they act as gatekeepers of morality, enforcing Christian nationalist values and excluding anyone who doesn‚Äôt conform. That‚Äôs not public service. That‚Äôs belief-based governance. ‚Äî Inside the White House, Trump has established a religious command center: * White House Faith Office led by televangelist Paula White-Cain, acting as a direct liaison between religious leaders and executive policy. * Task Force on Anti-Christian Bias, chaired by Attorney General Pamela Bondi, designed to investigate federal agencies accused of discriminating against Christians. * Religious Liberty Commission, chaired by Dan Patrick and vice-chaired by Ben Carson, coordinating religious policy across multiple agencies. Why it matters: These are not ceremonial roles. They embed religious ideology into the federal government, bypassing legislative debate and enforcing morality through executive power. ‚Äî The Victimhood Strategy: Weaponizing Christian Identity A core tactic in this system is reframing dominance as persecution. Trump and his allies now treat American Christians (who still hold vast cultural and institutional power) as a threatened group. The Task Force on Anti-Christian Bias, for example, isn‚Äôt just symbolic. It empowers the federal government to investigate educators, media, and civil servants accused of undermining ‚Äútraditional values.‚Äù The language of persecution becomes a tool to reshape institutions. Why it matters: It flips the logic of civil rights. Instead of protecting vulnerable groups from discrimination, the state now protects dominant religious ideologies from criticism. It redefines equality as oppression, and dissent as hostility to faith. ‚Äî Then came the branding strategy. Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúGod Bless the USA Bible,‚Äù sold at rallies, positioned his campaign as sacred duty. Evangelicals described him as chosen by God. Supporting him became not political, but spiritual. When voter loyalty begins with religious obedience, elected power becomes unaccountable power. Why it matters: He reframed democratic accountability as heresy.",Caregiver,Johnson & Johnson,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1livmxi/religion_was_never_out_of_us_politics_trump_just/

"NBA ALL-TIME DRAFT - Build Your Team! Hello Reddit and basketball enthusiasts! *Disclaimer: This is a long post and will go through editing and improvements. There was much consideration when determining the tiers and which players belonged where. Players chosen were weighted towards the modern era with some exceptions. I tried to have a nice balance between eras of players as well as a balance of play styles at each price point.* **Update 12/4:** I won't make any edits at this time, but I am considering moving Klay Thompson up to $800. He is one of the best shooters to ever play and a high level defender. If you have any other suggestions or changes, please let me know and they will be considered. Great response so far! I'll check back tomorrow. **In this exercise, the goal is to draft your ultimate NBA team using a limited amount of $ available. Each player has a price tag so you will have to think carefully about how you choose your players. The idea is to build the best team that you can. Think about how players would play together and compliment each other.** Rules: * You have $6,400 in total to spend on your team. * Players range from $1,300 to $600. * The average price of your players will be $800. * All players are considered in their prime and healthy. * There are 8 slots on your team. PG/SG/SF/PF/C and 3 UTIL. * You must have at least one of each position. UTIL players can be any position. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- To determine the players available, I utilized the following resources: ESPN's All-Time #NBArank Top 100: http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/page/nbarankalltime/greatest-players-ever (Full List Here: http://www.interbasket.net/news/19115/2016/02/the-full-list-of-espns-100-nbas-greatest-players-of-all-time-nbarank/) Bleacher Report All-Time Top 25 (By Position): PG: http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2223084-br-nba-legends-100-ranking-the-greatest-point-guards-of-all-time SG: http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2222903-br-nba-legends-100-ranking-the-greatest-shooting-guards-of-all-time SF: http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2218871-br-nba-legends-100-ranking-the-greatest-small-forwards-of-all-time PF: http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2215220-br-nba-legends-100-ranking-the-greatest-power-forwards-of-all-time C: http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2200009-br-nba-legends-100-ranking-the-greatest-centers-of-all-time -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- After considering these lists, I added a number of today's players as well. I tried to also include specific roles at various price points and skill levels (shooters, defenders, specialists). The best teams will likely have key utility players that help bring everything together. **For your reference, here are the tiers as they currently stand. The tiers loosely follow the ESPN All-Time NBA Rank lists. It was important to come up with these tiers before considering position so that players of relatively equal skill were in the same price ranges.** **$1,300:** Michael Jordan **$1,200:** Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell, Tim Duncan, Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal, Hakeem Olajuwon **$1,100:** Oscar Robinson, Julius Erving, Jerry West, Moses Malone, Karl Malone, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, David Robinson, Dwayne Wade, Kevin Garnett **$1,000:** Dirk Nowitzki, Charles Barkley, John Stockton, Isiah Thomas, Scottie Pippen, Chris Paul, Steve Nash, Kevin McHale, Patrick Ewing, Jason Kidd, Clyde Drexler, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Gary Payton, Ray Allen, Kawhi Leonard, Dwight Howard **$900:** James Worthy, Dominque Wilkins, Paul Pierce, Reggie Miller, Tony Parker, Paul George, Robert Parish, Tracy McGrady, Kyrie Irving, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Davis, Allen Iverson, Dennis Rodman, Dikembe Mutombo, Derrick Rose **$8",Caregiver,Johnson & Johnson,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/7hg73c/nba_alltime_draft_build_your_team/
"Global multinational branded products that are no longer made in the Philippines. Because of the expensive electricity and the water caused by the oligarchs, political corruption, &amp; the unfair land share of the 40:60 rule (just to safeguard the oligarchs), here is a list of multinational-branded products that are no longer made in the Philippines: * **Colgate-Palmolive products (Colgate, Palmolive, Tender Care, Irish Spring, etc)**. Their Makati factory began manufacturing their products in 1951, according to the already deleted YT video dedicated to Colgate-Palmolive Phils. Inc. (CPPI). On August 8, 2008; CPPI closed their plant due to high water &amp; electrical costs. Their plant is torn down to give way for a luxury condo called the Proscenium, owned by the same oligarch man that owned MERALCO. Snobbish hypocrite. CPPI wanted to return their production in the Philippines, but they need to wait for the utilities to lower their consumption costs. As of now, CPPI have to import their products mostly from China and Thailand. Colgate toothpastes are imported from China &amp; Thailand, Colgate Plax mouthwash is from Thailand, Colgate toothbrushes are from China (like most countries like the US imports), toiletries under the brands Palmolive, Tender Care, &amp; Irish Spring are also imported from Thailand. Ajax &amp; Axion cleaners are imported from Malaysia. CP's rival Unilever only makes toothpastes in sachets only while the tubes are from Indonesia and Vietnam. The only Pinoy-made toothpaste in the Philippine market are Hapee (Lamoiyan), Unique (ACS), Personal Collection (PC), and Avon (made by Lamoiyan under license). Look. Don't get me wrong. I loved the toothpaste of Colgate &amp; Unique. Two months after the closure of CPPI Makati plant, my mom and I, with my classmates at Montessori school, went to the Lamoiyan plant in Paranaque during my field trip back in grade 2 of 2008. * **SC Johnson products (Baygon, Glade, Pledge, etc).** Also at Makati City, SC Johnson's plant is just closer to the CPPI plant. They also closed down &amp; later demolished due to the same reason. Although, SC Johnson's aerosol products like Baygon, Raid, &amp; Glade used to be made at Aero-Pack (part of D&amp;L company) in Quezon City. In 2009, they closed down their plant, leaving only the 3 Indonesian &amp; 1 Vietnamese plant operational. Some SC Johnson products (mostly Pledge, Mr. Muscle, &amp; Baygon liquid &amp; chalk) are made by Multimix in Cabuyao, Laguna; while some (mostly Off &amp; Kiwi) are made by Telstar in Santa Rosa, Laguna. However, unfortunately, the Mr. Muscle spray bottles for kitchen, bathroom, &amp; glass, were transferred from Multimix Cabuyao to Cyberpax in Thailand due to their better quality. Those Pinoy-made Mr. Muscle sprays were exported to Malaysia &amp; Singapore, but due to a few poor reviews I saw (on Lazada MY &amp; SG, Shopee MY &amp; SG, &amp; Amazon SG), SC Johnson transferred those sprays (except for the mold and mildew killer spray on the same old bottle) from Cabuyao to Thailand. At least it is closer for Thailand to export to Malaysia and Singapore. The toilet bowl cleaner bottles under the brands Duck &amp; Mr. Muscle are mostly made in Vietnam. Remember Baygon spray cans being Pinoy-made? SCJ transferred them to China until 2024, which is now made in Thailand. SCJ in Thailand, Indonesia, &amp; Vietnam makes those spray cans while the PH, MY, &amp; SG imports them. Lucky. The only Pinoy-made insect sprays are the locals Kwik, Gecko, &amp; Target. * **Johnson &amp; Johnson products**. J&amp;J used to make their products like Johnson's baby products (shampoo, lotion, oil, powder). They even made Listerine. Nowadays, most of J&amp;J products are imported from Thailand &amp; Malaysia. J&amp;J Malaysia makes toiletries (shampoo, lotion, soap, etc) babies except baby powder and baby oil, while J&amp;J Thailand makes baby powder, baby oil, Listerine mouthwash &amp; Modess panty liners.

"The Definitive Guide of Comparing NBA Players to Classical Composers Edit: thanks for the gold. You're the Baron Gottfried van Swieten to my Mozart, and I appreciate it. Also added Dvorak, Chopin, and Rachmaninoff by popular demand. Lots of pianists in /r/nba, I see. *** Nobody will care about this, and I am perfectly fine with that. On a thread yesterday, some people (me, /u/W360, /u/gudbjartur) got to talking about classical composers and their NBA comparisons. I‚Äôm bored at work, so I figured‚Ä¶why not. I should note that I‚Äôm no scholar of classical music. There are tons of people who know more about it than I do. I‚Äôm just a guy who likes classical music and pro basketball. Basically, I wanted to stay mostly chronologically correct. I roughly matched up the eras of the NBA into the different epochs of what is more correctly known as Western concert music. The '40s and '50s are roughly matched up with the Renaissance era, the '60s are Late Renaissance and Early Baroque, the '70s are Late Baroque, the '80s are Classical, the '90s and early '00s are Romantic, and the late '00s and '10s are everything since: Impressionist, Contemporary, Modernist, Post-Modernist. However, just like eras in music overlap, certain basketball players may not be neatly sorted into chronological order. *** ## Renaissance Era __Guillaume Du Fay__: Regarded as the leading composer in mid-15th century Europe. Du Fay was prolific in the forms of the time: masses, motets, and other liturgical work. He was one of the first to utilize the newer harmonic structures of the early Renaissance period, and is widely considered the first truly Renaissance composer, much like __George Mikan__ is considered the first star of the NBA. __Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina__: an Italian renaissance composer, he left hundreds of compositions in his wake. He is one of the most influential composers in terms of style, even if people nowadays don't know it; kind of like how __Bob Cousy__ still has a huge influence on point guards despite the casual NBA fan not knowing who he is. __Claudio Monteverdi__: Widely regarded as the first Baroque composer, he was proficient in both Renaissance polyphony and Baroque _basso continuo_. He composed one of the first operas and is considered a revolutionary composer. He was influential in his time and pioneered a whole new style of composing, similar to how __Bill Russell__'s Celtics teams pioneered a new brand of up-tempo basketball. __Giovanni Gabrieli__: Represented the culmination of the Venetian school of Late Renaissance music. He was the organist at Saint Mark's Basilica, the most prestigious post in Venice at the time. His style underwent a change to a more modern style upon hearing Monteverdi's work. __Wilt Chamberlain__ had to make stylistic changes as well in order to beat Russell's Celtics. *** ## Baroque Era __Heinrich Sch√ºtz__: Considered one of the greatest German composers ever, Sch√ºtz wrote the first German opera, had a huge number of pupils, studied with Gabrieli, and was a great aggregator of talent during his 50-odd years in Dresden. __Jerry West__ certainly is no stranger to the creation of super-teams, both as a player (the Wilt-West-Baylor Lakers) and as an executive. __Alessandro Scarlatti__: an extremely prolific Neapolitan composer of operas and cantatas. He fathered two other famous composers, Domenico and Pietro Fillipo, and he moved around a lot, perpetually unhappy with his posts, similar to how __Rick Barry__ fathered two NBA players, Brent and Jon, but quickly wore out his welcome with most of his teams. __Johann Pachelbel__: Enjoyed great fame and popularity and composed a huge body of work. However, most people today know him only for Canon in D, like many NBA fans know __Walt Frazier__ as the rhyming commentator with the crazy suits, not the championship point guard for the Knicks. __Georg Philipp Telemann__: One of the most prolific composers in history. Compared favorably to Bach, even though Bach had mo",Caregiver,Johnson & Johnson,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4tmfn3/the_definitive_guide_of_comparing_nba_players_to/

He‚Äôs not my favorite, but I have nothing against him and wouldn‚Äôt mind him winning a major. It‚Äôs refreshing to have some pros that aren‚Äôt curating their brand and image for the fans. 2. There‚Äôs nothing sad about Dustin Johnson‚Äôs game right now. What‚Äôs sad are the guys with generational wealth that blow up their personal life to try to eke a couple more years out of their career. 3.

"What‚Äôs your teams easiest path to bowl eligibility? The CFP? For Rutgers, I‚Äôd say our most likely path to a bowl is winning our first four games, all of which will be at home (Ohio, Miami-OH, Norfolk State, and Iowa), then beating Purdue on the road and Maryland at home later on. I know we‚Äôre facing the MACs best, but Schiano usually starts the season strong and takes care of non-conference, and without Kaleb Johnson, Iowas offense may go back to normal levels. Purdue is going to be a program in transition, and we beat Maryland soundly on the road last year, a lot of the guys from that game are back this year. I‚Äôd say we have a 70% chance at being bowl eligible. The CFP? It‚Äôs a 1% if not 0.1% chance, but if it did happen, since we have a weak non-con and aren‚Äôt a big brand, we probably have to go 10-2. So add wins @ Minnesota, @ Washington, vs Oregon, and @ Illinois. The 2 Ls would be @ Ohio State and vs Penn State. Despite going 13-0 before the CFP, I still think Oregon‚Äôs floor and consistency as a program are lower than OSU and PSU. They lose a lot of production, and even last year they came close to dropping some games they really shouldn‚Äôt have.

"A sound actionable strategy to halt OGL 1.1 I suspect this post may be removed, so it is also on /rpg subreddit - if you care. \-------------------------------------- **Does this strategy work?** Yes (it has and does) **Do I think it will work?** I do not know - depends on the merits and supporting data of the letter and the current position of the analyst. I would not share it, if I did not think there were certainly potential considerations. **Why would you care?** If you are a content creator and part of the [OpenDND.game](https://OpenDND.game) movement, you may wish to consider this strategy. **Risk?** The risk in this strategy is time. I do not perceive any downsides, other than it may not work. However, if you do not try - you never know. I share this from my own insight, knowledge, and experience. Wall Street works on perception and window dressing of expectations. Facts are less important than shareholder perception. Perception drives stock price. To win, you need to play the same game that Hasbro does. It's all about money, hit them where it hurts the most and they pay attention, and changes are made. This is how it works in the world of public companies and Wall Street. Understand how to play the game and you may have a fighting chance for change to the OGL. \------------------------------------ # Hasbro is the adversary Hasbro is a public company, thus to create a proper strategy to defeat OGL 1.1, a plan needs to assess and understand how Hasbro thinks and what Hasbro values. Hasbro number one value is the share price and meeting shareholder expectations to drive the price higher, pay dividends, and for the execs/board to get their bonuses (and keep their jobs). They do not care about D&amp;D for what it is, but how it translates to shareholder value and stock price. Period - the end. **Who makes decisions?** Hasbro decision-making is done by the executives that run the company (Execs, C-Suite). They have a board of directors to whom they report and help steer the direction of the company. If the board of directors thinks the execs are not doing a good job, they remove them and find new executives. The relationship between the board and execs can oftentimes be incestuous as they may have quarterly, or annual bonuses based on performance. However, sometimes, with one or more large shareholders (activist investors) the board can remove execs and change the course of the company. **How are decisions made?** The Execs and Board look at one thing and one thing only, Quarterly Results (3-month period on how the company is doing and how it is expected to do next quarter). Their Quarterly Results are the core drivers in the market perception which ultimately drives the stock price. **The Quarterly Game.** First ‚Äì Wall Street analysts (people at major institution firms that monitor the company financials, news, and other information) set a ‚ÄúQuarterly Expectation‚Äù for the company and this may include ‚ÄúUpgrades‚Äù or ‚ÄúDowngrades‚Äù. The Quarterly Expectation is a discrete number based on the expected profit or loss per share. Downgrades and Upgrades are the analyst recommendation based on the set expectations. Is the company doing better or worse and will they meet the expectations analyst set. Second - the Execs and Board read these expectations and now the game begins. They will steer the company‚Äôs decisions in an attempt to beat the expectation. If they can beat the expectation, they win (probably get bonuses) and help the stock price go up. If they fail, they do not get bonuses and the stock price goes down. This process rinses and repeats every quarter. * Hasbro reports the FY 2022 Earnings on February 6th, 2023 * Hasbro‚Äôs following quarterly report is on April 24th, 2023 (1st Quarter). **Influencers** Hasbro has three groups of influencers in its decision-making. 1.

"[WWE/Professional Wrestling] The People versus Roman Reigns Professional wrestling has a very insular, misunderstood and (in Daniel Bryan's words) fickle fanbase that is also chock-full of assholes at every level. A lot of the drama that springs up here is very dense and emotion-driven, as well as being incomprehensible to most outsiders. I'm gonna try my best to keep the tangents and insider wrestling jargon to a minimum here, so feel free to comment about any parts you don't understand. I'm also recalling a ton of this from memory, so bear with me. **A Quick Glossary:** WWE - World Wrestling Entertainment, formerly the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). For the purposes of this post I may refer to WWE/WWF interchangeably. Kayfabe - wrestling lingo for ""in universe"", the overall masquerade that dictates all the onscreen action/drama is ""real"" and the wrestlers are the characters they're playing. Babyface - the ""good guy"" or hero in a story. Also called a ""Face"" for short. Heel - the ""bad guy"" or villain. Conventional wisdom in the industry often dictates that heels are more interesting characters than faces. Because wrestling. Heel turn - a good guy turns evil and becomes a heel. Despite the above conventional wisdom, this is *not* always a good thing. Face turn - a bad guy turns good and becomes a babyface. Smark - shorthand for a hardcore wrestling fan, for the purposes of this post. A portmanteau of ""smart mark"", which has elaborate carny roots I won't go into here. #Introduction The central conceit of professional wrestling is guys doing a mostly-convincing performance of beating each other up, often against the backdrop of a wider feud or narrative spanning months or even years at a time. Think MMA, but less boring and with soap opera dramatics. And like any other soap opera, wrestling had its designated heroes (babyfaces) and villains (heels). Let's get one thing out of the way: WWE is the biggest wrestling company in the world, and you'll be hard-pressed to find a wrestling fan who hasn't heard of some version of it. WWE is also synonymous with wrestling itself to most (but not all) lay people across the world. WWE's biggest storylines play out on one of two weekly TV programs: Monday Night Raw, and Smackdown Live. (WWE's third major weekly show, NXT, is a whole other messy story that merits an entire post of its own.) WWE also has monthly pay-per-view shows - think Wrestlemania or the Royal Rumble - which often serve as the ""climax"" to a given short- or long-term feud. There are generally three types of viewer attitudes towards the overall brand: * Type 1: casual fans (""marks"") who believe **WWE is the center of the wrestling universe**; * Type 2: more ""involved"" hardcore fans (""smarks"") who know that **WWE is just one wrestling company out of many**, each with its own style and ethos. However, due to the nature of wrestling and the [controversial history](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_WWE) of how WWE became the industry leader in the first place, there is significant overlap between Type 2 and * Type 3: **WWE is evil**, in the classic ""Big Bad Monopolistic Multimillion-Dollar Corporation"" sense that embodied everything wrong with capitalism. So... what does all of this have to do with Roman Reigns? #The WWE Ideal There are certain ""fan myths"" that have been built around wrestling over the years, WWE in particular. Some are more true than others. A common one is that WWE has terrible storylines, and that they're incompetent at writing babyfaces. One of the most pervasive myths (of many) however revolves around Vince McMahon, WWE's longtime CEO (and occasional onscreen villain) who also had the final say in most canonical feuds and storylines behind the scenes. According to most smarks, Vince McMahon is a size queen. Which is to say he favors ""larger than life"" wrestlers built like bodybuilders with a bombastic personality to match. Think Hulk Hogan or The Rock or John Cena: they're the epitome of Vince's d",Caregiver,Johnson & Johnson,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/lzpat4/wweprofessional_wrestling_the_people_versus_roman/

"Why I‚Äôm Buying Rivian Stock Individual stock picking is for smart people who wear expensive suits. I‚Äôm not very smart and I hate wearing suits. I‚Äôm a boring index-fund guy. After all, history and math show us that the safe path to retirement is to simply plop money into a Vanguard fund every month. And that‚Äôs what I do with most of my money. But sometimes I see a juicy opportunity that fires me up. Occasionally, the timing of that opportunity is juuuuusst right and I put real money on the line. This is one of those situations and I'd love to hear what you think about it. I recently bought 4000 shares of Rivian stock (RIVN). My average cost is just over $16/share. That amounts to about $65,000. At the time of this writing, Rivian floats around $15.00/share and has a $14.5b market cap. I might buy another 1000 shares depending on the feedback that I get to this post. Anyway, here is why I believe Rivian will 3-4x in the next few years. # Point #1 ‚Äì Big Picture - EV‚Äôs Will Win‚Ä¶ Guaranteed. Over the next 25 years, the auto industry is going to transition to electric vehicles because they will be cheaper to buy and operate. Hear me out: 1. Right now, batteries are the most expensive part of an EV. But EV battery tech is in its infancy. Incremental advances in batteries will increase the energy density and versatility of batteries year by year. More importantly, the industry will scale battery production by a few orders of magnitude. This will make EV batteries significantly cheaper to purchase on a per unit basis. 2. Government‚Äôs will continue to incentivize EV purchases with tax credits and other incentives for decades to come. In the long run, governments are definitely going to incentivize large scale energy creation by renewable means (which is getting cheaper and cheaper). On the other hand, western Governments are not going to subsidize or incentivize more coal power plants. That is just a fact. 3. Moreover, gas cars are only going to get more expensive operate because gas is a finite resource. The world is literally running out of oil. We‚Äôve only got like 100-200 years left. So, gas prices are going to go up guaranteed. On the other hand, we ain‚Äôt gonna run out of electricity. Humans will continue to innovate and drive down the relative cost of electricity. This is inevitable. I know I‚Äôm painting with broad strokes here, but I think any rational mind will agree with most of these assertions. Stay with me. This post gets better as I go‚Ä¶ Now, just because EV‚Äôs will be less expensive than ICE vehicles in the long run doesn‚Äôt mean Rivian is going to win the game. OEM‚Äôs like Ford, GM &amp; Stellantis are starting to produce and sell EV‚Äôs‚Ä¶ right??? Won‚Äôt Ford and Toyota and others crush Rivian at the EV game? Nope‚Ä¶ not a chance. Keep reading and I‚Äôll show you why. # Point #2 ‚Äì Pure EV Makers like Rivian &amp; Telsa Will Crush Traditional Auto Manufacturers Ford, GM, and Stellantis don‚Äôt stand a chance against Tesla &amp; Rivian. Even if they start making compelling EV‚Äôs for customers, OEM‚Äôs will be at a long-term structural disadvantage to Rivian &amp; Tesla. Here is why: 1. Rivian does not have a dealership sales model. Dealerships are a useless 3rd party which customers hate. Removing the dealership permits Rivian to sell its vehicles for cheaper than it otherwise could, but also make more profit than it otherwise could. This will be a long-term structural competitive advantage over OEMs. 2. Rivian does not have unions. Unions uniquely harm the automobile industry because the cost of strikes and the cost of artificial wage increases after the strike ends increase the cost of vehicles. The 2023 UAW strike is a good example. If Rivian treats its employees with dignity and respect, they should avoid unionization. This will be a long-term competitive advantage over OEMs. 3. Rivian will make money from servicing and repairing vehicles. In the current OEM-dealership model, the dealership makes more money from the service department th",Explorer,Jeep,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/19f3fgb/why_im_buying_rivian_stock/
"Discussion on rivian's longterm viability. Will the ""outdoor/adventure"" branding and marketing limit its potential? I'm a preorder holder and with the Preferred Stock email that went out this afternoon I've been thinking about the longterm viability of the company post R1T and R1S. Rivian's marketing is somewhat heavy on the idea that it is an outdoor and adventure brand. My thought is that this may be targeting a fairly specific demographic. Also this seems to limit it's potential future offerings to ""adventure vehicles"", meaning, a 4 door sedan doesn't really make sense for an adventure company. I'm aware of the Amazon delivery vehicle deal and that's of course promising, I'm just wondering what you all are thinking about the future of the company and it's potential for non-off-road vehicle offerings.

"[Animation] Chip and Pepper &amp; the 1991 Programming Block That Ended Saturday Morning Cartoons on NBC And Inspired a Cult Comedy on Netflix Hi there. Relatively new reader, first time poster. Enjoy a little early 90s hobby history. &amp;#x200B; Recently Netflix premiered [Saturday Morning All Star Hits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPAr3-4egRU) a parody of late 80s and late 90s children's programming created by Saturday Night Live alumni Kyle Mooney. In each episode a series of animated shorts are hosted by two radical 90s brothers named Skip &amp; Treybor (both played by Mooney.) Many of the shows parodied in the series are fairly obvious spoofs, for example ‚ÄúCreate-A-Critters‚Äù is riff on ‚Äúpuffy cheek‚Äù plush toy inspired shows like Care Bears and Popples. Also much of much of the humor is based on human failing. Randy for instance is a college aged depressed parody of Denver the Last Dinosaur who binge drinks as a coping mechanism. Skip and Treybor develop a toxic case of sibling rivalry after a voice acting role propels Skip to greater fame and popularity. Meanwhile reality keeps crashing in on Skip &amp; Treybor's neon colored lo-fi world. Cartoon segments abruptly end or become drastically retooled while an OJ Simpson-esc trial begins to interrupt the show. While you don't need to be a 90s kid to appreciate the show's humor what many have missed is that Mooney is satirizing a very specific programming block that marked the death knell for children's animation on one of America's largest and most respected networks. &amp;#x200B; **A Titan In Decline** &amp;#x200B; In the 80s NBC was a major player on Saturday Mornings largely thanks to such hits as Smurfs, Alvin &amp; The Chipmunks, and Disney's Adventures of the Gummie Bears. However by the time 1990 came along the network was in dire straights.

"The Bike You Have vs. the Bike You Wish You Had ü§î I've been riding a couple of years now and have a 2021 Honda CB500x. As much as its a great all-around platform, I've been feeling the itch to upgrade to something better - problem is I don't know what. This post is 1/2 seeking advice and 1/2 rant. haha. I really love motocamping and have been on week+ long trips all over the American west. A typical trip usually has 1-2 days of interstate driving at 85mph followed by lots of gravel roads and some more remote jeep trails up mountains, across deserts, etc. The CB does all of this ""fine"" but has always felt like a road bike cosplaying as an adventure bike when I go off-road. When I look at my ideal bike, it really shows the hole in the market for a \~500cc adventure bike which is touring capable but also an off-road weapon. I am really excited about the KLE500 release but also wary of buying brand new models due to teething issues so it will probably be 3 years before I would commit to buying one, and since we haven't seen it, who knows how nerfed it will end up being (BMW GS 450 cough cough). https://preview.redd.it/po94zu0swauf1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=581d75e2ab5ca7cbaf3754bad3aaad89bcf8d6e3 I am always solo and go to remote areas, so reliability and low weight are super important to me. I don't want a bike that can go anywhere, but leaves me stranded. Or one that I dump in the sand, and then can't pull out on my own. So no 500+ pound GS's or KTMs or other bikes with questionable QC, although the 390 adventure R's looks and spec sheet makes me drool. Bikes with sub 500cc engines won't handle interstate speeds here in the US west and dual sports aren't ideal either for that reason. So that leaves the Honda Transalp or Tenere. I've heard the Tenere is uncomfortable to ride all day and the top heaviness and seat height make me lean towards the Honda Transalp. But here's my question: Is the Transalp just a faster CB500x (road biased platform that feels out of place off-road)? How much better will it feel off-road than the CB? Does the greater suspension travel and other off-road features out weigh the greater weight (no pun intended)? If I am being honest, I've never really felt like the Transalp has that cool factor, too. Maybe that would change if I wrung out that hornet engine? Not sure where Honda design went from Rally inspired to minivan inspired. I saw a couple gen 1 Africa Twins in Europe last year, so cool. https://preview.redd.it/thh5rfux0buf1.jpg?width=398&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09eb6b7f360e5d74396dbd265f5a50712c00034e Rant over - I'd love your thoughts!",Explorer,Jeep,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestAMotorcycle/comments/1o34vhx/the_bike_you_have_vs_the_bike_you_wish_you_had/
"Comparison: Toyota Innova Hycross vs Jeep Meridian **Toyota**‚Äôs latest entry in the Innova family, the Innova Hycross, is a capable 7- &amp; 8-seater MUV that has already drawn comparisons with the Innova Crysta and Fortuner. Outside of the Toyota family, there is a case to compare it to another new premium 7-seater, the Jeep Meridian. For its SUV-inspired design, a host of premium features onboard, and expected price, the Toyota Innova Hycross is a fitting competitor to the Meridian. In this comparison of the Toyota Innova Hycross vs Jeep Meridian, we break down the differences and find out which of the two is more suited to your requirements. # Toyota Innova Hycross vs Jeep Meridian: Dimensions &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/z9fppqd4ao5a1.png?width=859&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c02ab6c4933454ddd8b700d63d2b69a979d23a0 &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/l9uyvd25ao5a1.png?width=870&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e93aae96b98bc12a18a2c4bcc208089f5f9c97f While both cars are 7-seaters, they differ vastly from each other in terms of road presence. Though the Toyota Innova Hycross has been given an SUV-inspired front fascia, the side and rear profile is quite similar to that of the Innova Crysta. The MUV has a sedate appearance and looks appealing as a premium MUV. In contrast, the Jeep Meridian is a true-blue SUV and sports a muscular design while still maintaining a sophisticated appeal. The American SUV looks quite similar to its elder sibling, the Jeep Grand Cherokee, which has recently been launched in India. &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/guafb2n9ao5a1.png?width=867&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f8124d75444fca097a371032928b510e93dfff9 In terms of size, the Jeep Meridian is 14 mm longer and 9 mm wider than the Toyota Innova Hycross. However, the Toyota Innova Hycross is 97 mm taller and has a 105 mm longer wheelbase. The longer wheelbase of Innova Hycross can be accredited to its monocoque construction and the front-wheel-drive system. The **Toyota** Innova Hycross is significantly more spacious than the Jeep Meridian, especially in the third row which is usually a critical aspect of a 7-seater. Furthermore, while both cars come with the option to fold the third rows to extend the boot space, the 300 litre of the boot of Hycross with all three rows up, offers better luggage carrying space. The two cars also differ in their layouts, with the Jeep Meridian‚Äôs 7-seater layout offering a three-seater second row, while the Hycross‚Äô 7-seater layout offers a three-seater third row. However, this is totally up to buyers preference where they like the three-seater row to be in their cars. &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/rim0gehaao5a1.png?width=869&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e2b8e0efbba6a82cb3551a87af79573d044959f In terms of mechanicals, both cars are built for different purposes and have different advantages over each other. Both petrol power plants of the Innova Hycross deliver more power than the turbo diesel engine of Jeep Meridian, and its hybrid unit delivers an alluring mileage of 21 kmpl. Moreover, the Toyota Innova Hycross is quicker than the Jeep Meridian and can do a 0 to 100 km/hr dash in 9.5 seconds, whereas Meridian can do the same in 10.8 seconds. However, the unavailability of a manual transmission is a limitation and might leave driving enthusiasts wanting more engagement with the car. The Jeep Meridian, on the other hand, generates more torque and feels punchier to drive. What‚Äôs more, Jeep is a brand that has always been known for making very capable off-roaders, and the same holds true for the Jeep Meridian. The SUV has been given an all-wheel-drive drivetrain in top variants and 203 mm of ground clearance, to drive through most terrains without any hassle. Unlike the Innova Hycross, the Meridian features a manual transmission, offering more manual control while driving. # Toyota Innova Hycross vs Jeep Meridian: Features &amp; Comfort &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/",Explorer,Jeep,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/carcomparison/comments/zkwovl/comparison_toyota_innova_hycross_vs_jeep_meridian/

"Is the Jeep Renegade Sport Trim Suitable for Mild Adventure? Hey guys, I'm certainly not a car guy and am looking for a bit of advice. I'm driving the PanAmerican Highway in a couple years(Alaska to Argentina) and I originally wanted to do it in a Wrangler. But when I noticed that a 5 year old Wrangler with 65,000 miles is only about 5 grand cheaper than a new one(and I don't want to take a brand-new vehicle on the trip), I decided a Renegade would be a suitable alternative. My question pertains to the trim level. When I began researching Renegades, I read that the Renegade Trailhawk is the only one that is 'ready' for off-road use. My road-trip will encounter gravel &amp; dirt roads quite regularly, and I also plan on doing a bit of beach driving. I won't necessarily seek out off-road trails, but I'm sure I'll encounter a little bit of that while going off-route. Will the Sport trim be suitable for that? I'm finding a lot of YouTube videos that almost make it seem that the Sport is damn near as capable as the Trailhawk. Could anyone with more knowledge on the subject let me know if the Sport level would be suitable? I'm willing to spend a few extra grand to get a used Trailhawk, but it seems most of the CPO Renegades in my area are the Sport.

"Trip Report: Joining a 40 Day Africa overland tour solo with G Adventures I recently went solo on a 40 Day G Adventures Africa Overland Tour through Eastern and Southern Africa. One of the main reasons I‚Äôm writing this, is because when I was doing research on if I wanted to do an Africa Overland tour or not, there weren‚Äôt many reviews or personal accounts of these types of trips to help me decide, I went in blind. And luckily it all worked out really well! Going with an overland tour group saved a lot of headaches with logistics like border crossings, car rentals, corrupt police, etc. Also as a solo traveler, it was a great way to explore Africa with other like minded people, many of whom were my age and also solo travelers (I signed up for an 18-39 year old‚Äôs trip, although the mean age was mid 20‚Äôs). I did a G Adventures Africa Tour and would definitely recommend them to others. Many other tour agencies (Intrepid, Contiki, Absolute Africa, etc.) do similar routes and I imagine would have similar experiences, with the biggest difference between them being the length of the trips and different types of accommodation and transportation (hotels/hostels vs camping like I did and occasional flights instead of long bus rides). What also convinced me to go with G Adventures over the other tour options, was the 39 year age cut-off. I didn‚Äôt want to be stuck on a bus for 40 days with a bunch of couples or retired people, and I thought this gave me the best odds.

"[Star Wars Expanded Universe] The strange and obscure story of how a potential trademark claim by a vehicle sunroof manufacturer seemingly prompted the replacement of a major Star Wars video game character *This post originated as a comment in the Hobby Scuffles thread for the week commencing 20 March 2023 and its main body was written before* [*my previous Star Wars ""hobby history"" post*](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/120niw0/star_wars_expanded_universe_dark_horse_comics_del/)*, so it might be of lesser quality. I have endeavoured to fill out the details a little, as best I can.* \---- I made a post previously which described an episode of historical drama which relates to the Star Wars Expanded Universe and, even though the comments started to verge into the usual combative tedium which inevitably afflicts all Star Wars discourse on the internet (all Star Wars fans are incurably incapable of praising anything without tearing something else down, but this is the condition in which we find ourselves and it is as immutable as the fact that all Star Wars fans are inveterate bullies), I think it was reasonably well-received. I will now relate a further story of some odd and occluded background drama from the Star Wars Expanded Universe, and I am pleased to note that this time, it is just a strange little story which involves no overt miserableness. You may, indeed, find it moderately amusing. This is the story of how mysterious legal issues relating to a automotive accessory trademark apparently resulted in a major change being made to one of the most beloved Star Wars games of all time, and might even have contributed to the near-disappearance of a couple of once-significant original characters from the Expanded Universe entirely. **Tales of the Jedi** Our story begins in 1993, an indifferent year for Star Wars. This year saw the publication of *The Last Command* by Timothy Zahn, which concluded the popular Thrawn trilogy and, with it, the first chapter of the new Star Wars Expanded Universe. (Incidentally, this year *also* saw the publication of *Mission From Mount Yoda*, *Queen of the Empire* and *Prophets of the Dark Side*, altogether the second half of the Glove of Darth Vader series, in which a three-eyed slave lord pretending to be Emperor Palpatine's three-eyed son attempts to marry a robotic duplicate of Princess Leia in an Imperial wedding ceremony presided over by a grand moff in a flying Professor X chair reading from a dark side Bible, only to be killed when the robotic Princess Leia shoots him with its laser eyes.) Most significantly for our purposes, though, 1993 brought a new series of comics published by Dark Horse called *Tales of the Jedi* (hereinafter ""**TOTJ**""), written primarily by the late Tom Veitch in occasional collaboration with Kevin J. Anderson. This should not be confused with the animated series which ran on Disney Plus in 2022 which used the same title (and the same logo, oddly enough); this was a series which forayed into the far distant past of the Star Wars galaxy and told stories about the adventures of the Jedi knights who lived 4,000 years before the events of the Star Wars movies. The comic's second story arc was previewed in [*Dark Horse Comics* \#7](https://i.imgur.com/Wm1xuAz.jpg) and ran subsequently in TOTJ #4-6. It was called ""[The Saga of Nomi Sunrider](https://i.imgur.com/7xblLGX.jpg)"" and it introduced one of my all-time favourite Star Wars characters (can you tell?) in the form of a young Jedi named **Nomi Sunrider**. As the widow of a Jedi knight who becomes a Jedi herself while raising her young daughter, she is a character who could probably *only* have been created in 1993, when the Star Wars Expanded Universe was in its infancy, artists and writers were taking a few swings and feeling out the setting and seeing what would work and, most importantly, George Lucas had not decided that Jedi could not marry or have children yet.

"The Gurgel Tocantins. A small and rugged off-roader made by Brazilian brand, Gurgel Motores. Long post. **THE BEGINNING** Opportunities arise when you are in the right place at the right time. While walking through the Ipiranga neighborhood of S√£o Paulo in 1956, engineer Jo√£o Augusto Conrado do Amaral Gurgel noticed a lot of activity in a warehouse on Rua do Manifesto: the first Brazilian Beetles were being assembled there, an operation managed by German Friedrich ""Bobby"" Schultz-Wenk. That was the beginning of a friendship that would culminate in a successful partnership ten years later: produced by Macan Ltda., the Gurgel 1200 starred at the 1966 Auto Show with a VW chassis and engine, in the Ipanema, Xavante and Enseada versions, the latter of which was displayed at VW's own stand. It was a four-seater convertible, ideal for leisure. (Post I made about the Gurgel 1200 in this sub: https://www.reddit.com/r/WeirdWheels/s/VtOBCBMWoD) Of the three, only the Xavante prospered: it became an off-road vehicle similar to the Porsche 597 Jagdwagen, replacing the VW chassis with one manufactured in-house, in Plasteel, a steel coated with fiberglass, an invention patented by Gurgel itself. Rebranded as the X-12, it was exported to several countries, establishing the Gurgel name as synonymous with a brave little off-roader that was up for any adventure. **THE TOCANTINS** The first-born of engineer Jo√£o Gurgel would shine again in 1988: renamed Tocantins, it gained a new front end with rectangular headlights and a cabin extended to the end of the body. The extra 20 cm (7.87 in) guaranteed more space for passengers, but eliminated the external fuel tank and air filter, trademarks of the X-12. The L version, which had a canvas roof, and the TR, with a hard roof, remained, with the latter eliminating the traditional ventilation skylight in the roof in favor of a luggage rack. Another novelty were the beautiful external door handles of the Fiat Pr√™mio CSL (sedan version of the Fiat Uno, known in other countries as the Fiat Duna). Inside, there were few changes: the dashboard kept the instruments of the Beetle, but replaced the controls of the Fiat 147 (Brazilian version of the Fiat 127) with those of the Gol (small Brazilian car that replaced the Beetle). There were two trim levels: the LE was the simplest, painted in a single color and with seats covered in rough leather. Above it was the Plus version, with colored stripes in a blue, green, orange or gray gradient, as well as an interior covered in gray fabric with red stripes. The tank capacity was increased from 37 l (9.78 gal) to 41 l (10.83 gal). The off-road prowess was maintained, thanks to the high ground clearance, good entry and exit angles and the presence of the Selectraction system, which acted as a selective lock for the rear wheels (in practice, it was a handbrake that locked the drive wheel if it was spinning freely). The powertrain maintained the old and reliable air-cooled VW 1600 engine, coupled to the short-ratio gearbox of the Beetle with a 1300 engine. The intention was clearly to please an urban audience, who saw the small Gurgel as a good option for a cool and easy-to-drive car. To curb its risky behavior on the asphalt, the front suspension received a stabilizer bar and the rear spring load was revised, improving tire contact with the ground. This is the case of this 1991 model, which belongs to S√£o Paulo collector Felipe Olivani: ""The Tocantins was one of the most versatile vehicles in the S√£o Paulo Military Police fleet, especially in the Environmental Command."" The only change to the jeep was made in 1992, with the adoption of a new front grille and glove compartment with a metal lid from the BR-800 model. Financially weakened after the failure of the BR-800, Gurgel filed for bankruptcy in 1993. In total, 3837 Tocantins units left the Rio Claro (SP) factory until it closed its doors in 1995. The little jeep left no successor and can still be seen in action today, ",Explorer,Jeep,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeirdWheels/comments/1ihlea5/the_gurgel_tocantins_a_small_and_rugged_offroader/

"690/701, 390 ADV R, or Kove 450 for next bike? Help me choose. A wonderful wall of text for you all, tldr at the end. Looking at getting my next bike this summer and the list has been narrowed down to these 3. Currently have an XR650L, and while it fills almost the same role as these bikes I want more range (I have a big tank and it‚Äôs not enough plus puts a lot of weight high up), a 6th gear/better road manners, and most importantly fuel injection as I ride in Colorado and the altitude changes wreak havoc on getting the carb to act right. Been riding street for 7 years, only had a dual sport for 1 so I‚Äôm still relatively new to off-road, but loving it. Use case is going to be riding highway up to mountain trails, mostly jeep trails/ 2 track and generally exploring with some single track sprinkled in if I‚Äôm feeling like it. Eventually doing BDRs and such. Would also occasionally commute on the bike but I‚Äôm looking at also grabbing a street bike again dedicated for that and road fun (god I miss my sv650). Here‚Äôs the thoughts I‚Äôm having with the bikes in order for which I think is best for my situation. I know the Kove and 701/690 have been compared before but haven‚Äôt seen the new 390 ADV R in many discussions with them, on paper they fill a similar role, at least to me. My budget is about 10k + whatever I get for selling my XR (probably 2-3k) but I can stretch a bit. First place: KOVE 450 Rally Pros: Great fuel range, Low dry weight and center of gravity (the big tank on my XR makes it feel very top heavy, which I‚Äôm trying to avoid on the next bike), Love the rally look and fairing, Seemingly great suspension from reviews, Decent aftermarket and community knowledge so far Cons: China (lot of people saying it‚Äôs very well put together but I think the highest mileage I‚Äôve heard so far was around 3k so long term still a bit unknown), Tariff situation may make parts harder/more expensive to get Second place: 2025 KTM 390 Adventure R Pros: Bit cheaper than the Kove, Close to same power as Kove, Better electronics package (quick shifter, cruise control, ride modes, but not super important to me), Rally style and fairing Cons: Current KTM situation, Suspension specs not as good as the Kove, Less range than the Kove, Sameish wet weight as the Kove with a big tank up top (possibly more top heavy), Brand new model and made in India (kinda unknown long term but going off the old 390 engine should be fairly reliable‚Ä¶ for a KTM), Also, so new that there really no aftermarket for it yet and the KTM situation makes it unknown if enough will get sold to even create one, Most importantly I hate the color orange Third place: 701/690 enduro Pros: Moar powah baby, Proven design, relatively reliable, Most people‚Äôs unicorn, Light-ish weight, tank under seat keeps center of gravity low Cons: Price, Price to get it set up on top of the base price (rally tower/fairing, larger tank, etc.) add like $4-6k from what I‚Äôve seen, Again the current KTM situation, Might be too much for me off-road but I can use a gentle wrist if I need to, Did I mention price yet? Holy crap this is an expensive dual sport, I would have to slow roll the necessary items for me as I budget upgrades over a few years which means it wouldn‚Äôt be the bike I want from the start like the other two and would not allow me to get a street bike too Honorable Mentions: Crf-450rl - short maintenance intervals, low range, expensive, my first runner up but costs as much as the 701 to get it where I want it in the end and at that point I choose the 701/690 for the extra power. CF Moto 450MT - too heavy, not off-road focused enough Drz-4s - 5 speed, down on power, low range, lack of wind protection options AJP-PR7 - not street legal in the US (to my knowledge) and very little aftermarket/parts support Any of the ‚Äústreet legal dirt bikes‚Äù are out for low range and not being tolerable on the highway as well as low service intervals.

Also, going over a curb in new construction I dinged the crank when it bottomed out and didn‚Äôt have my foot/feet up. Rookie mistake 2.0. Won‚Äôt be doing either again and have already been conscious to have the outside foot down on turns to avoid catching the crank. Pluses Price. Yes. With the new models on showroom floors I got this one for $3199 CDN. Great buy considering what the original MSRP was when the bike came out. Whenever we make a purchase we purchase while keeping the the likely life of the product in mind. We amortize the purchase over that expected life cycle. Is it nice to be young? Yes. Is it nice to be at an age in life to be able to afford things that aren‚Äôt part of a constant upgrade cycle? Yes. Before you assume we are flush, I drive a base 2015 Jeep Cherokee and my wife drives a 2023 Toyota RAV XSE hybrid. Hardly the luxury models some of our family and friends our age drive.This was a purchase we saw as something worth premium branding and more importantly something we can do together. The build quality and quality of components are premium. I know people with the cheap e-bikes and there is literally no comparison. From the quality to the execution‚Ä¶ even something like cable management and routing, far superior. All of the components are quality name brand which to me is both a plus and piece of mind.The fenders are just so great. The brakes are top notch. I find the saddle comfortable and supportive. I had a gel saddle cover the one on the Marlin 6 but no need on the Como. Today‚Äôs ride was over 1 hour and 21 minutes on a paved path that circles our city that is about 24-25km in distance (called the Rotary Trail shout out the the Rotarians), and my rear end was fine. I got the bike last Saturday and took daily rides of 14km to 16km (except for yesterday when I got home late). Zero discomfort while riding or afterward. And the suspension seat post‚Ä¶ a huge plus. It absorbs the bumps but doesn‚Äôt travel so much or so often that the ride seems jittery; I love it. Same with the front forks. Well paired to mainly riding on paved paths and streets. The headlight and tail light are both bright, and living in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, Canada, this time of year I ride after supper when it is approaching dusk so they are a must. The hand grips are very nice as well. The 1 by with 11 gears is plenty and the shifting mechanism is very nice( a new style to me). The battery appears to be strong. I only use the motor when hill climbing or into a head wind so most of the daily rides were 2-4% battery use. Today‚Äôs 24.5km ride only used 5%. I should get decent range out of the daily rides. I am doing the first charge while writing this post. The motor is stone silent and seems like part of the peddling motion. Nothing mechanical or weird about it. Very very nice indeed. The iPhone app and software on the on bike computer are exceptional. I need to figure out how to enable Find My for my iPhone but other than that smooth sailing. I find the data between the specialized app and the Apple Fitness app to be rich. The riding position. This was the aspect I was most concerned about but I find the body, arm, and hand position to be very comfortable even on the 1 hour 20 minute ride. I know this is very much a YMMV thing, but for me I like the higher vantage point for sightline and see it as a plus, and I find nothing about the body, arm or hand positions to",Explorer,Jeep,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ebikes/comments/1nggl47/2023_specialized_turbo_como_40/
"Looking into getting a new manual transmission vehicle. Hey y'all, just figured it couldn't hurt to ask a question here. So I'm looking into getting my first-ish manual transmission vehicle. Little background info... I actually had a little manual ford ranger years and years ago, I was talked into/forced into buying it by my mother. Threats were involved (Get a car or I throw your 17 year old ass out of the house. She's gone, none of us ever could figure her out) and my grandpa was ""Oh Tina, this truck is so great that if he doesn't buy it **I** am going to buy it."" So I did. But the catch was, the engine had blown up or something and been replaced. Now I'm not a mechanic, but my Grandpa and Uncle are. So, deal was, I bought it because they told me to, so they had to fix it. And thus the battle of the hydraulic clutch began. Turns out that in this part of Ohio, you can get a new clutch no problem...but you couldn't get the hose.... So while they were facing that battle, I was with mom, learning how to drive a manual. No problem I was told, as my grandpa had taught both his kids manual, and had/has a foolproof teaching method! (He also threw my mother out when she was 16. I bet you'll never guess the reason. Internet super-cookie for anyone who can. Hint, it has nothing to do with anything XXX or drugs) So she got one, we got inside and as you can guess, I stalled out the first time. And the second time. Almost had it the third time. Got it on the forth, but stalled out shortly thereafter. At which point, Mother dear settled on her tried and tested *screaming at you* method. This did not help. At which point she threw me out of the car, took over driving, and left me on the side of the road in a cloud of dust. I stood there like a big dumb 17 year old, until she came back 20 minutes later with a roar of ""See how god damn easy that was?!"" No. No I did not. For I was standing on the side of the road Mother.... Back at Castle Grandpa, the 2 Hay men were locked in battle with a Ranger. A Ranger that refused to be defeated. So after blowing off every hydraulic hose they tried, it ran for 15 minutes and then never started again. Thus declaring itself the victor. Thus ended my time with a manual transmission, and started my weird wacky adventure of going through 4 different cars before I ever got to drive a single one of them. Now, many, many years later. I find myself with a 2019 Ford F-150 STX and a job where I do a *whole lot* of driving. I got the truck due to the fact that I live in an area that can get some **Monstrous** snowfall (This year we got 3-4 feet in a day), and a block of snow in an otherwise clear freeway took my Honda Civic right **TF** out. So, 4 wheeled drive and higher off the ground seemed like a good idea. Now I don't precisely need a new car as I've been blessed with little to no mechanical problems with my truck. I just kind of want one. It's also got 108 thousand miles on it, and I question how long I can be so lucky. But I big problem I keep running into, other than the fact that manual is somewhat rare nowadays, is all the vehicles to choose from these days seem to be saddled with very small engines with turbos slapped on them. Now, again, I'm not a mechanic (Welder by training that I've barely used. Sad world) but when I hear ""2.0 liter I4 turbo"" engine on a big ass truck, I'm skeptical. A turbo four-banger on what's supposed to be a big badass machine? Not to mention that just getting to manual transmissions means you have to go up ""Trims"" that cost tens of thousands more. Now I'm at a bit of a loss. I know about the Honda Civic Type R. I'm also aware of the Ford Mustang GT Fastback with it's big V8 engine. When I was a kid, V8 was all the talk. Where would we go from there? Kids would whisper about V12? V16? What would science cook up? Inline-4 with a turbo apparently kid. I also found what appeared to be a nice 2015 Jeep Wrangler with a 3.6 liter V6 engine.

"My incredible grand dad is 69 today. To celebrate, here is a story from one of his books, translated into English for the first time. By me. The War Will Finish On Wednesday. I hope I do it justice &amp; that Reddit enjoys it. :) He has lived an amazing life, which would make an epic adventure book - I kid you not - but amongst the most noteworthy, and I guess what made him famous - as well as controversial - were the 4 years he spent at the Afghan War, as a political correspondent for the Central Television of the then USSR. To put it simply, that war was a tragedy of both national and international scale but also a deeply personal hell that touched a great many families throughout that war. It ravaged the USSR and many of its people, just like it ravaged Afghanistan and fuelled fires of hate, extremism and division that still burn to this day. There were a great many things that separated politics and personal perceptions at that time and immediately afterwards, and it remains a conflicted and painful subject for very many Russians to this day. None of this, in my opinion, diminishes his work; he had unprecedented access to the Army, was included on many military operations and reported, literally, from the front lines. As well as his detractors, he has many, many friends from that era, not least the ex President of Ingushetia, Ruslan Aushev, who was so instrumental in negotiating the rescue of some of the hostages in Beslan (again, amongst the roll call of greatness that is his life) and is at a restaurant table right now, with my Grand Pap, lifting rounds of vodka to help him celebrate. Na zdorovie! He has published a great many things in his lifetime and after he came back from that war, alongside my Grandma who worked the entire time by his side as the cultural correspondent from Kabul, they returned with a huge archive of stuff that, due to censorship, was never to be seen. A few years after their return, the dacha caught fire due to some faulty electrics on the neighbour's side (!?) and the entire archive perished. Something I'd love to do is get his work to be seen and published in English - so I guess this is the first step towards that end! I'm graduating from lurker with this post - so, please, be gentle... and I am looking forward to what y'all are going to have to say about it :). If I've unintentionally ignored some sort of Reddiquette, I am guessing you guys will let me know...Here goes!

In retrospect the reason was simple: by this date, set by mutual agreement between the USA and the USSR, every last one of our soldiers had to have left the country. And so it was the last Monday before that fateful Wednesday. A day, remarkably warm and sunny even for an Afghan February.

"A Request of Bob Broderdorf First off, I am happy to see the direction Bob Broderdorf and his crew are taking our beloved Jeep brand. Stellantis made a great choice, as the did with Kuniskis at Ram. That being said, Jeep has to have a reckoning on it's out of touch pricing structure. Jeep made its bones on being a dependable ""every man's"" adventure vehicle-oriented company. I have owned Jeeps since I was 16 years old. Thirteen Jeeps in total. 40 years later, I still have one. As with the vast majority of Jeep enthusiasts, I couldn't wait for a V8 Wrangler. But, as with most, once the prices were announced, I was disappointed and disgusted. Please consider putting a 5.7 in it, dropping some of the unnecessary luxury nonsense, and pricing it at around the $60k market, and win back your base! I know I am far from alone in this.

"Go anywhere. Do anything. Unless you have a warranty issue. Until this experience, we‚Äôve loved our Jeep and being part of the Jeep community. Wranglers are known as the vehicle to ‚ÄúUnleash adventure. Go anywhere. Do anything.‚Äù and our family set out to do just that on a 32-day road trip spanning over 7,000 miles from Michigan to Washington and back. Unfortunately, just 1,500 miles in, on June 23 in Rapid City, SD, our Jeep let us down. A failed battery, covered under warranty, sidelined us. The replacement part? Initially expected to arrive in a week and now not expected to arrive until July 17, nearly a month later. We contacted Jeep Cares and were given a case number‚Ä¶ but no answers. No guidance. Just the promise that a case manager would reach out sometime after 24 hours. So we were left with two choices: 1. Cancel the next portion, potentially all of our trip, incurring a domino of cancellation fees. 2. As the dealership had no vehicle loaner options for us, rent a vehicle and pay out-of-pocket to continue our once in a lifetime journey. Eventually, Jeep‚Äôs offer of support? $50 a day toward a rental. In today‚Äôs market, that‚Äôs barely a dent and they reminded us ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt even have to do that.‚Äù There was no offer toward lodging. No meaningful effort to make things right. This response stands in stark contrast to other automakers, like GM, where providing a rental during warranty-covered repairs is standard. Now we are 2,200 miles from home without support from Jeep.

"Jurassic Park/World Franchise Short Term Solution After watching Jurassic World Rebirth, I am left wondering where the franchise should go from here. Realistically, it will continue on its current path until the movies are no longer profitable, go extinct for a few years until the inevitable reboot. Let‚Äôs assume the movies will continue (whether or not they should), where can they go from Rebirth? Nowhere interesting. I posit they should go backwards (for at least one movie). The next film should take place in the most interesting era of the franchise, directly following the original film. Isla Nublar is the most interesting setting in the Jurassic franchise, as evidenced by Jurassic Park and Jurassic World and the beginning of Fallen Kingdom. We don‚Äôt need more secret research islands or stations, we have the original park. Is this nostalgia bait? Of course it is, I‚Äôm working with what I‚Äôve got here. Set the film immediately following the original and follow a rescue team onto the island. How does anyone know Nedry isn‚Äôt alive at the end of the original film? Were other staff unaccounted for when the island lost power? It would be really cool to see a team of pros walk past the destroyed jeeps and search the island showing us familiar locations from new angles. I would make this a horror film similar to Alien. No need to bring in legacy cast members as they are not age (or plot) appropriate. Make it a small cast getting picked off by dinos one by one like Alien or Predator. No hybrids or locusts or globetrotting adventures, just a moderate budget dinosaur horror movie. No A-list cast needed. Throw in Timothy Olyphant as the team lead/hero and you‚Äôve got a stew going. This does not solve the long term problem of the brand, but it does reset the current trajectory and opens the door to smaller stories.

"Every Company That's Owned Jeep‚ÄîA Brief Ride Through History Jeep‚Äôs story starts at the battlefields of World War II but the brand‚Äôs corporate adventure is just as dramatic as its off-road reputation. Each era of ownership has shaped Jeep‚Äôs DNA, sometimes with innovation and sometimes under real financial strain. Here‚Äôs how the journey unfolded, and why Jeep‚Äôs survival is remarkable in the turbulent world of automakers. Everything began in the early 1940s with Willys-Overland, the Ohio manufacturer that brought the first military Jeeps to life. Willys-Overland churned out many of the Willys MB vehicles that carried American troops across Europe and beyond. After the war, they adapted the battle-tested design into the first Civilian Jeep‚Äîthe CJ series. In 1953, the Willys brand was struggling to compete. Kaiser Motors, who had experience in both wartime and peacetime production, stepped in and acquired Willys-Overland. The company became Kaiser-Jeep. This era saw expansion beyond the military and farm markets. Civilian Jeeps matured, the Wagoneer was born, and Jeep began to look like the go-anywhere SUV icon we know today. By 1970, Kaiser-Jeep was sold to American Motors Corporation (AMC). AMC was a mid-sized US automaker always on the hunt for something that set it apart from the giants. Jeep was their ticket. AMC helped Jeep move forward, developing the Cherokee‚Äîa model that would define an era and kickstart the SUV craze. The XJ Cherokee changed the game with its unibody design, blending classic styling with improved comfort and capability. AMC also oversaw ambitious international partnerships, including a joint venture with China that marked a milestone for the global automotive industry. But AMC faced tough times, so in 1979, French automaker Renault stepped in with investments and influence. Renault brought new designs and some European flavor, but the heart of Jeep remained American. The brand was now not just about rugged capability but also about style and family life. Fast forward to 1987 and another major shift: Chrysler Corporation purchased AMC, snatching up Jeep as its crown jewel. Chrysler invested heavily in Jeep, redesigning the lineup and pushing the Grand Cherokee into both suburban driveways and rugged trails. Under Chrysler, Jeep transitioned from a utilitarian survivor to a brand mixing luxury and adventure. Chrysler itself went through a wild ride, merging with Daimler-Benz in 1998 to form DaimlerChrysler. The German-American partnership promised innovation, but cultural clashes hampered lasting progress. In 2007, private equity firm Cerberus Capital bought Chrysler, leading to another challenging period as financial turmoil shook the auto sector in the late 2000s. Salvation arrived in 2009 when Fiat Group, the Italian auto conglomerate, reached a deal to merge with a struggling Chrysler. The resulting Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) era brought renewed investment, global ambition, and fresh models like the Jeep Renegade and modern Gladiator truck. Jeep‚Äôs reach exploded internationally. The new owners poured resources into manufacturing and marketing, sending Jeeps to fresh markets in Asia, South America, and Europe. Classic models like the Wrangler also got updates for changing times, all the while keeping their off-road core. Most recently, in 2021, FCA merged with PSA Group of France‚Äîmakers of Peugeot and Citroen‚Äîto create Stellantis, a global automotive giant. Jeep is now a global brand, leading the adventure segment across continents and preparing for an electrified future. Yet through all these changes, Jeep‚Äôs personality stayed consistent: freedom, adventure, capability, and a certain rebellious charm. Decade after decade, Jeep endured corporate takeovers, mergers, bankruptcies, and reinventions. Wherever it landed, engineers, designers, and loyal fans kept the roots intact. Every new owner brought big changes‚Äînew factories, new markets, fresh technology, and ambitious investments.

All across US and Canada over 10s of 1000s of miles. Mostly 2 lane roads, gravel, dirt, with the occasional water crossing and rutted roads. And interstate, although I avoid 95% of the time. I have turned to wanting to recreating these same types of adventures and routes, but with a VW Beetle. I want to make a Baja Bug (looks and function), but not to the extreme of actually baja-ing it. Riding the same roads the above motorcycles ride. (They were equipped with more aggressive tires and have 4""-6"" of ground clearance.) Most everything I read is to get a 69+ standard/classic beetle and not a super beetle due to the strut suspension. So in my area, classic beetles are tough to come by. They're either nice with a price of $8000+ or less than $3000, but are usually trashed rust, all kinds of things the owner says needs fixed (easily). /roll eyes. A super beetle on the other hand are plentifully and are in the missing price range $3000-$7500 which is where I want to be, but maybe I'm foolish. Both for the price range and considering a super. So, would a super beetle be terrible for what I want to do. Give it the Baja Bug look (high fenders, larger AT tires) and still do the roads mentioned and travel across US/Canada. A true touring adventure rig. I feel like when mentioning a super beetle in the community is like when Jeep people say you can't wheel a IFS Jeep cause it'll explode as soon as you take it off pavement. And real world advice, pro/cons is appreciated.",Explorer,Jeep,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/beetle/comments/1o3688w/advice_adventuretouring_beetle/
"Guide to Everest Base Camp Trek : Tips and Information from a Trekking Guide in Nepal Hey there, I have noticed a strong lack of information and variation in accuracy throughout the posts that I have came across in this subreddit. Hence, please allow me to share the right information as a Trekking Guide working here in Nepal regarding the Everest Base Camp Trek. By the end of this article, I assure you would be more confident to tackle this amazing hike by yourself if needed be. [Taken from Kala Patthar \(iPhone 15 Pro Max\) - Late December 2023](https://preview.redd.it/ukh6bw3xezdf1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30b1f144430455cda3ee13a4f93ca662d54fc68b) **Introduction** Everest Base Camp Trek is a classic trek that takes you the Base Camp of the World's Highest Mountain, the Mt. Everest. This classic trek generally starts with a Flight to Lukla either from Kathmandu or Ramechhap depending on the Government's decision. However usually in peak seasons, you have to make your way to Manthali Airport at Ramechhap and undertake the flight to Lukla. This short 25 minutes flight would take you the fabled Lukla Airport from where your hike begins. **Transportation - Getting There** To do this trek independently, you have to arrange with an Agency for the Flight Tickets as I have observed it is rarely sold through official airlines website and mostly sold out or reserved by agencies. The cost of the flight is 210 USD one way, so expect about 420 USD for Kathmandu - Lukla - Kathmandu flights. **Alternative Transportation Options** * **Jeep to Salleri and another Jeep to Surke and Hike to Phakding** With the fairly recent road connectivity up to Surke, you can also take the Jeep to Salleri from Kathmandu and embark on a proper off road adventure to Surke from Salleri. There are provision of Shared Jeeps to Salleri and on to Surke. If you have a fairly larger group (4-5 pax), you can take this option as its more economical and reliable. However, expect about a day of drive to Salleri on Day 1 and another day to reach Surke with a late hike to reach Phakding on the 2nd day. * **Heli In to Lukla** You can also avail shared Helicopter flight to Lukla if its feasible for you. There are some operators who collect individuals and arrange the Lukla Flights at about **500-600 USD per person** in high season. Though I have definitely heard stories about trekkers getting really lucky and paying even less or at some cases, charged higher than this price. Usually, flight cancellations over multiple days sees the surge in helicopter fares. For coming out of the region after the trek, you can follow the same transportation options. Use the road route, flight or heli-out options. **Everest Base Camp Permits** As of writing this article, you would only require following permits to visit the Everest Base Camp, **1. Sagarmatha National Park Permit - NRs. 3000** **2. Rural Municipality Permit - NRs. 3000** You can get these permits **at Lukla before your descend to Phakding at the end of the villag**e or **at Monjo at National Park entrance gate.** The documents that you should have are - **Copy of Passport along with original** **P.p. size photograph (1-2 pcs)** You would be provided with a Trek Identity Card with a NFC Tag with your details that needs to be shown at different checkpoints where they would make the entry. **Connectivity and Internet** I would suggest you to go for sim-card from **NTC (Nepal Telecom)**. It has got more remote coverage and depending on the times of the season, works up to Dingboche with proper 4G connection. There is reliable data connectivity when 4G connection is active. However in high season, for some reasons, the 4G Connection stops working making the Trekkers and the Trekking Staff more reliant on **Everest Link Wi-Fi cards** that they sell at the Teahouses which costs as much as NRs. 800- NRs. 1000 for 10 GB and 24 hours usage time.

"Evaluate the Best Marine Speaker System Pyle PLUTV52CH Worth It The Pyle PLUTV52CH off-road speaker system has been an impressive companion ever since I began testing it. As someone who frequently dives into the world of audio equipment‚Äîespecially setups for multiple environments like boats, UTVs, and jeeps‚Äîthis speaker system has genuinely caught my attention. From its marine-grade build to the crisp sound quality, it seems to have been built with outdoor enthusiasts in mind. But, of course, no product is perfect, and throughout my use, there were a few quirks worth noting. **Build Quality and Rugged Design** Durability was one of the first things I inspected. The speakers are encased in a tough molded casing with a rubber surround, and they‚Äôre IPX45 waterproof. Taking them through some rain-soaked trails in my UTV didn‚Äôt faze them one bit. They shrugged off mud, dust, and water splashes without compromising on audio performance. Even mounting them on the roll cage of my buddy's boat was a breeze with the universal mounting brackets. However, the mounting brackets, while sturdy, felt like they could be a little more user-friendly during installation‚Äîtightening those screws may require some patience. **Audio Performance: Clarity Meets Punch** I was genuinely impressed by the sound this system produced‚Äî1000 watts of sheer audio power wasn‚Äôt just a number. Testing on an open trail was where the speakers really showed off. The bass carried over the roaring engine of my ATV, and the clear highs from the neodymium tweeters made vocals pop in every track. Despite being in harsh outdoor conditions, sound clarity wasn‚Äôt lost, even when the volume was cranked up. The two-way speaker design, combined with a polypropylene cone and butyl rubber surround, delivered a surprising level of depth. **See Pyle PLUTV52CH deals on Amazon now.** **User Versatility and Everyday Use** What I appreciated was how versatile this system is. Whether mounted on a boat for a quiet lake trip or attached to a jeep for off-road excursions, it adapted effortlessly. The 2-inch aluminum brackets supported all mounting needs for different vehicles. The compact marine amplifier added an extra level of control and power, though I occasionally found the wired connections a little cumbersome. If Bluetooth capability had been included, it would have been a game-changer. **Highlights** ‚Ä¢ Dynamic 5.25-inch speakers with crisp audio and strong bass. ‚Ä¢ Universally mountable on multiple vehicles like UTVs, boats, and ATVs. ‚Ä¢ Rugged waterproof design capable of withstanding harsh outdoor elements. ‚Ä¢ 2-channel marine-grade amplifier with impressive protection circuitry. **Shortcomings** ‚Ä¢ Mounting brackets could be a bit more intuitive for installation. ‚Ä¢ Lacks wireless connectivity options like Bluetooth, limiting modern usability. **Connection Options and Features** The inclusion of a wired RCA input was a fantastic touch for those who like a retro approach or need to connect analog devices. I ran it through my MP3 player and even a projector during one backyard gathering, which actually became a huge hit. The integrated wiring harness ensured the setup wasn‚Äôt overly complicated. However, it‚Äôs worth noting that its reliance on a wired connection might feel restrictive for users looking for more modern connectivity like Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. **Product Competitors** I‚Äôve compared this with a couple of other marine-grade audio systems from brands like Boss and Rockford Fosgate. While Boss systems offered competitive sound quality, they lacked the same rugged outdoor build as the Pyle PLUTV52CH. Rockford Fosgate‚Äôs pricier models delivered better detail in sound, particularly for audiophiles, but at almost twice the cost, depending on the setup. For most users, the Pyle system delivers better value when you prioritize outdoor durability and power over minute audio nuances. **Affordable Quality Evaluation** While the price point may initially seem like a splurge for some users, the",Explorer,Jeep,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ResonantRejects/comments/1ne79nf/evaluate_the_best_marine_speaker_system_pyle/

"How do you start over? Let me pre-face this by saying, yes I (41f) lost all sense of self preservation and common sense at the point I am about to get to. 4 years ago I owned my own home, had two cars I was making payments on because they were both mine. I was raising my two girls and working 72 hours a week making good money. I had an off again on again now permanent ex of 5 years who spent a year begging for me back. Long story short his promises of love and affection and being a stay at home mom going on adventures and raising my girls and being his wife finally got to me. I sold my home, one car broke due to his negligence and he talked me into selling my jeep and also talked me into a trash jeep I didn‚Äôt really want but he swore he would due the work on it (he never did) I gave him the money from my taxes and my house sales for the down payment for a home he bought, we got engaged etc. Long story short, he wanted a whore, a maid and a yes sir anything you say sir, girl. We broke up after 2 years. (It‚Äôs worth saying I suffer from treatment resistance major depressive disorder and bipolar2) I had to leave the house. I gave my girls the choice to stay with me or move with their dad who is more stable. They chose him. Well the younger one did then he also convinced the older one, and while it sucks and hurts alot everyday I know he‚Äôs a really good dad and him and I get along fine. Anyway. I found an apartment. It didn‚Äôt last long, I couldn‚Äôt afford it and I lost it. I moved in with a man who I swore was going to be my husband 8 months later. Long story short. He was abusive, selfish and anytime I tried to leave he made it so my jeep was no longer drivable by intentionally messing it up as well as ripping out the tire valve stem in pure rage while I was trying to drive away. Another long story short there, I finally called my best friend to pick me up after he smashed my brand new iphone 16. He‚Äôs lived in the town his entire life and the police are no help. Now I‚Äôm at my friends house staying in an extra bedroom with very little of my possessions and the worst part is lack of transportation. I can feel the animosity she has of me still being her 3 weeks and not finding a job yet. All my belongings not in storage are at my exs and when I tried to unblock him asking when I could get them back he said I had to call him and when I refused he said I could write off all my stuff left behind then. I really need to know the kick start to get my life back. I‚Äôm quickly falling into a badly depressed state and not having a vehicle or the ability to make money is really triggering it. Not to mention my age, I feel like all the applications I‚Äôm putting out there are being laughed at because of that. And I also feel because of the insane prices of everything I‚Äôll never be able to be on my own again and that‚Äôs the catalyst of my entire mental health. What can I do to get back to being an independent adult woman who has no vehicle. No savings (I worked for free for my ex, he called it worked for rent and helping with bills. I also gave him all my tax money to help him) No vehicle and no talents. I‚Äôm a loser at this point. And a moron who learned to love too late in life to have any sense about it.

[[Check Latest Arrivals 5x5 5 to 6x5 5 wheel adapters on Amazon.]](https://blog.trendsupplier.com/clearance-section/?kw=5x5 5 to 6x5 5 wheel adapters) # Best 5x5 5 ‚Äãto ‚Å§6x5 5 Wheel Adapters 2025: Find Yours Now! Wheel ‚Å£adapters serve ‚Å£a vital function for car enthusiasts adn off-road adventurers alike, allowing them to mount wheels with different bolt patterns on their vehicles.Specifically, ‚Å£5x5.5 to 6x5.5 wheel adapters are crucial for ‚Äãadapting wheels from vehicles with‚Å§ a 5x5.5 inch bolt pattern to those requiring a 6x5.5 inch‚Äã configuration, or vice versa. This can open up a‚Äå wider range of wheel options, improve aesthetics, or even enhance performance by utilizing different wheel sizes and offsets. Choosing the right ‚Äåadapter requires careful consideration of ‚Å§material, thickness, safety standards, and vehicle compatibility.## Key Features Analysis The best 5x5.5 to 6x5.5 ‚Äãwheel adapters of 2025 boast several essential features‚Äç that ensure safety, durability, ‚Å¢and optimal performance. **Material Composition:** These adapters are primarily crafted from high-grade billet aluminum, typically 6061-T6 or‚Å¢ 7075-T6. This aluminum alloy provides exceptional strength-to-weight ratios, ensuring that ‚Äãthe adapters can withstand the stresses of ‚Äçdaily driving and off-road conditions without adding excessive‚Äå weight to the vehicle. The use of billet aluminum also allows for precise‚Äã machining, resulting in tight tolerances ‚Äãand a secure fit. **Adapter Thickness:** The‚Äã thickness of the adapter plays a crucial role in achieving the desired‚Äå wheel ‚Äåoffset.Common thicknesses range from 1 inch‚Å§ to ‚Å£2 inches (25mm to 50mm) or even larger depending on the ‚Äçapplication.‚Äå Selecting the‚Å¢ appropriate thickness allows for‚Äç the wheel to ‚Äåsit flush with the fender or to create a wider‚Äã track ‚Äãwidth ‚Å£for improved stability‚Äã and‚Å£ handling. It's essential to measure‚Äã carefully ‚Å§to ensure the wheel doesn't extend beyond the fender, which‚Äå could lead to rubbing or‚Äã other issues. **Bolt‚Äã Pattern ‚ÄåConversion:** The primary function‚Äå of these adapters is to convert the 5x5.5 inch‚Å§ (5x139.7mm) bolt ‚Äçpattern to a 6x5.5 inch (6x139.7mm) bolt pattern, or vice versa. This means ‚Å¢the adapter accurately aligns‚Å¢ the new wheel's‚Äç bolt pattern to the vehicle's ‚Äåhub. Precision is paramount to ‚Å£prevent vibrations and ensure the wheels are securely mounted. **Stud Grade ‚Å¢and Hardware:** High-quality studs are‚Äå critical for ‚Å¢the safety and longevity of the wheel adapters. grade 10.9 or higher studs are‚Å¢ generally used, providing exceptional ‚Äãtensile strength and resistance to shearing forces.‚Å§ These studs are ‚Å¢frequently enough‚Å¢ pre-installed into the adapter. Lug nuts designed ‚Äãspecifically for use with aluminum adapters are also included, typically made from hardened steel with a conical ‚Äåseat ‚Å£for proper ‚Äåclamping force distribution.**Hub-Centric‚Äã vs. Lug-Centric Design:** Many ‚Äåadapters feature a hub-centric ‚Å£design, meaning they have a center ‚Äåbore that matches the vehicle's hub diameter. This ensures ‚Äãthat the weight of the vehicle is supported by the‚Å¢ hub ‚Å§rather than the wheel studs, ‚Äåreducing stress and‚Å£ vibration. Lug-centric ‚Å¢adapters, on the other hand, rely solely‚Å£ on the lug‚Å¢ nuts for ‚Äãcentering the wheel. While ‚Å¢lug-centric adapters can be used, hub-centric designs are generally preferred‚Äã for‚Å§ added‚Äå safety and stability.**Surface Finish‚Äå and Corrosion Resistance:** To withstand harsh environmental conditions, the‚Äã adapters often feature an anodized or powder-coated finish.‚Äå This protective layer prevents corrosion,rust,and oxidation,ensuring that‚Äå the adapters maintain their‚Äã structural integrity and appearance over time.‚Å£ Black anodizing‚Å§ is a‚Å§ common choice, providing ‚Äãa ‚Å¢sleek and durable finish. ## Core Benefits Using 5x5.5 ‚Å§to 6x5.5 wheel adapters ‚Å£offers several significant benefits. **Expanded Wheel Options:** The primary benefit is the ability to mount‚Å£ wheels with a different bolt ‚Äåpat",Explorer,Jeep,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerCreativityA/comments/1mu3hx2/best_5x5_5_to_6x5_5_wheel_adapters_2025_find/

"F**ck Huggies, Pampers and all these enshittified American diaper brands. Try Les Petits Culottes instead. First time father here. I am a witness of how large corporations reduce the quality of the baby diapers to the absolute minimum. They all cost the same, so you don't have a reference for true value. But those gas station toiler paper-thin diapers suck. My wife is from the South of France and she got recommended a local company [https://www.lespetitsculottes.com/fr/](https://www.lespetitsculottes.com/fr/) because that's what frenchies do: shop local and by word of mouth. We live in Italy, and we decided to order some diapers. Holy shit. Same price (or maybe less?) than huggies or pampers, and the quality is incredible. Built like tanks, approximately 3X more absorbent material, super soft all over the place. They never spill. They ship outside of France and you can make a subscription and they send you bulk packs every month. The diapers are made of recycled materials, bio certified, low CO2 footprint, the whole thing. They also sell baby formula, but I haven't tried it yet. It costs a couple of Euros less than what I buy locally. So, I will be trying that one out. They ship outside of France.

It was messy, we were on and off for almost 5 years. He was always clear he wasn't ready for a relationship and I was always clear I was madly in love with him. Everytime I got tired of the situation and wanted to leave somehow he convinced me to stay, because love is free, we have so much time together, he wasnt ready to commitment. I asked abvice to my sister (now42f) and she gave me some crappy advice like made him compromise, leave sfuff at his place and basically turn him into a boyfriend until it was to late to him to say no. I never managed to do that because I wanted him to love me as much as I loved him, not trap him. During the last night I spend at his place he said he wanted to try something more serious with me, talked about some dates he planned etc. Only to ghost me forever. It was hard. This was the first person I loved and he treated me like crap. Six months passed and my sister came home, we both lived with our parents, saying she wanted to introduce her brand new boyfriend, she had have ton of boyfriends but she said this was the one, it was a dinner only with my parents at our home so I was excluded and expected to just go out or chill in my room. The day came and while they were dinning I ordered a pizza I came downstairs only to find the guy I was with six months prior dinning with my parents and sister. I was shocked but pay for my pizza and went to my room again to cry. After dinner was over I confronted my sister in front of our parents and begged her to not be with him. To be loyal to me, her little sister. There was no way she didn't know who he was, I had showed her pictures of him, his socials media, where he worked and she even know where he lived, they never met because he didn't wanted to met my family and never introduced his. But she knew who he was and she excluded me from that dinner because she _knew_ She said they met by chance after we stopped seeing each other. She knew how hard that ""rupture"" was, she knew how painful it was to not have even a closure, he just stopped replying, not even blocking me just left me there wondering after 5 years. She knew that during those six months I was still hurting. I know how it was my fault, I was too naive and thought that if I stayed long enough he would be ready for the relationship I wanted and would learn to love me. Stupid, I know. She defended herself saying it was a coincidence and chemistry was there, she loved him and she wasn't going to lost the love of her life, this stuff only happens once in lifetime. When I was in my early twenties I would believe that, however now I know that there are 8 billions people in this world, there's no ONE love of your life, you can find the love of your life multiple time if look for it. My parents sided with her and said I should get over it since we never have a real relationship. One and a half year had passed. I've been excluded from multiple family gatherings because he would be around and my family thinks I will bring negative vibes since I'm still bitter about everything. I have no feelings for him but I feel betrayed by my sisters and my parents, he is just pos on my eyes now. My sister is now six months pregnant, due her age she had been extremely pampered by my parents. She still lives at home and is going to move with him maybe two months after the baby is born.

And even said I should have posted here first. I'm dividing the post into two halves to make it easier to read. My MIL is insanely entitled. And my wife's enabling of her has made our marriage very hard at times. MIL has come to us for money a lot because she keeps spending herself into a hole since she's a hoarder and a shopaholic. Her house is full of garbage, junk, and unopened stuff she never uses. The house is rodent infested too. She has one semi-clean room in the whole building. And it's the master bedroom. She's mocked it up like a little studio apartment with a futon to sleep on and use as a couch, an entertainment center with TV and streaming, and a makeshift kitchen consisting of the adjoining bathroom, a mini-fridge and a microwave. MIL's also overweight because she eats out a lot. Recently MIL came to us wanting me specifically to buy her a new smartphone as an unprompted gift. And she threw a massive fit when I refused. And I mean a child temper tantrum kind of fit. Why did she want a new phone so suddenly? Hers was two years old, that's literally it. As far as I know, it still worked fine. Even my wife has confirmed this. But MIL was resolute that she deserved a new phone. And before leaving, MIL yelled at us that we're supposed to be pampering her now that she's an old woman. She's 53. My wife also didn't want to buy her mother the phone because she gave her money not long before to make sure her bills were paid. I have quite a collection of vintage skeleton keys. And I mean good ones. Like ones to particular hotels, the large ornate Sargents, brass railroad keys, Reading Hardware, etc. My collection as a whole should easily be worth two to three thousand dollars. Some of those keys are super rare. I kept them in a locked display cabinet. But a few days ago I came home to find my entire collection gone. The cabinet had been forced open. I checked the CCTV for the living room, and saw my MIL force open the cabinet with a small crowbar. She then put all the keys in a couple of boxes she'd brought with her and left with them. I called MIL right away and demanded she return my collection. She nonchalantly told me she sold the entire collection at pawn already, and used the money for her new phone. Then said it was my fault, and she had to do it because I wouldn't give her the money. My wife was seemingly on my side, until I said I was going to call police. She begged me to just drop it. And even suggested I just start a new collection. I refused to let it go, because a lot of those keys are not only expensive, they're irreplaceable. I spent 10 years building that collection. But my wife kept blowing up at me and telling me to just let it go. So I slept in the guest room that night and sought online help the next day when my best friend told me to try Reddit. I'd been a lurker before. But making an account wasn't hard. My MIL has been trouble in the past.

"My sister is proof that blood isnt thicker than water I hate my sister, i really do, she is the most disgusting spiteful creature in the world. Lately she has been getting into boys alot, she is just twelve but she stuffs her bra and she tells boys she loves them and she will fuck them. She uses my stuff, like not to a normal extent she uses every brand new thing i get, i am not allowed to enjoy anything that i buy without her stealing it, i beg her not to touch it but she will go ahead and do whatever she wants. She cusses my mother out whenever she tries to deal with her, she hits my mother and my father does'nt do anything because in front of him she is the sweetest angel. She beats me if i even touch her things, she does'nt let me study, she tears my textbooks if i even touch hers. We took her to a therapist but she pissed the threapist off and refuses to go in for another session. She does not study at all and my dad just pampers her. She is genuinely scared of him but he claims he is too stressed with work to deal with what goes on at home when he isn't here. I can't do this anymore, i wish i was a single child i really do. I hate her so much. She is the brattiest, most self centred disgusting person i know. I cannot belive i am related to her. At the age of tweleve she has vaped and has had two boyfriends and abuses my mother and me emotinally, physically and most of all verbally. I am helpless and I wish my parents never created her. Guys i just wanted calrify a few things: 1. It is not the my parents fault, They have been extremely supportive and loving to both her and me, They have tried their best to raise us to be good people. Yeah, she is definetly pampered at home but she has been hanging out with a group of 13 - 16 yr olds who vape and kiss in public, like full on make out in front of litreal toddlers in the park. some of them smoke weed and cigarettes and most of their parents dont care about their kid or facilitate their childrens actions, its so fucking horrible because just two years ago she was a sweet little girl, we were really close. I never thought she would become the person she is. Today i asked her to move so i could get someting from the shelf behind her and she threw a plate at me and it broke a tile of on floor. My dad is currently out of country, but he is usually home today, if he was here she would'nt have dared to do that. she also kicks my mother when my mother tries to discipline her, and my mother doesnt hit back. SO i dont think it is my parents fault other than the pampering her part. I have tried to stop her but she does not listen. My parents are not aware of the type of people she is with, i have my best tried getting her to leave them. She unlocks the bathroom door takes photos of me when i change and blackmails me using them so i cant even tell my parents. You see why my life has become a living hell with her? 2. I used to beat her up initially, i still remember the first time she raised her hand at me. But it is emotionally draining becuase if i start hitting her back the fight drags out for days on end, If i retalite to her she does'nt stop torturing me she will break my things and tear my clothes to get revenge on me, my dad used to scold her at first but then i just stop retaliting and just take the shit she gives me because i cannot do anything else. My dad is tried of discipling her and me and my mom helpless. I just wish she was never born, my life would have been so much better, i cant do anything anymore and i just keep telling myself that i will leave for college soon. She is litreally a horrible person. I thought i would add this but my sister is also addicted to the phone since she got it three years ago, i was in the tenth grade but she was jut in the fifth grade, we got one each to help with online classes. And she is addicted to it. Just a few hours ago my mom tried to take the phone away, it resulted her in ripping the covers of my mom's bed off to search for it, alon",Caregiver,Pampers,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/18aqat2/my_sister_is_proof_that_blood_isnt_thicker_than/

She didnt have a consistent diet, just whatever was on sale at the time. She was FILTHY .. and I mean we have been bathing for an hour and gone through an entire large bottle of shampoo tonight. Still gross. I couldnt even get my pinky under her collar. Theres dreads forming around her butt and collar line. Covered in sap spots on her belly. A bit overweight to boot. List goes on.. poor dog ownership, let alone fostering, really pisses me off... Im going to consult the vet about this but since its sunday evening, I could use advice as far as hard starting her on a new food. I typically do orijen brand foods for my dogs. I love the ingredients. No ""meals"". Is there any way I could help ease her into it without knowing which brand she was on before? Or just rip the bandaid off.. I had a Pembroke Welsh for almost 16 years but never had to switch food except for flavors so she didnt get bored of it. Im unsure how corgis respond to sudden food changes.

"Diaper Comparison 2025 TLDR: Created a spreadsheet to compare my top diaper options in US. First pic is sorted by price, second pic is sorted by which I‚Äôll be trying first. (Currently pregnant with my first). Details: All diapers listed are hypoallergenic and all have wetness indicator (two requirements to me). Benefits examined: - Chlorine free or ECF - Fragrance free - Paraben free - Phthalate free - Other notable benefits - Biodegradable How I chose my top picks: - Each benefit column has different value, determined by important to me. (For example, biodegradable would be nice, but not as important as being fragrance free, so I only gave 0.5 points if noted as biodegradable). - Point totals for each row is in column 10 - Only considered items from stores convenient to me. Ideally would like to be able to have in stock at 2+ stores just in case. - The blowout barrier pockets seemed like a real appeal to me Results - my Top 5 (ish) Picks: 1. Up&amp;Up 2. Huggies Little Snugglers (or the Plus version at Costco) 3. Pampers Pure 4. Bambo Nature 5.

"SEX EDUCATION 101 for INDIANS \[This is a repost\] Hey! Sex and Sexual Education barely/never gets talked about in India. I'm a 26F who's been sexually active since the last few years. Whatever I've learned, has been from girl-friends, experience, porn (SEX IS 294739% DIFFERENT FROM PORN) and erotica novels There are SO so many things I wish I knew *before*.....or wish I didn't have to learn from experience. Hence I've made this post for all my fellow women, men, and everyone in between. This post is written from a woman's POV but I **strongly advice everyone to read it** regardless of gender and orientation. **Trigger warning** \- There are mentions of Sexual and mental trauma in this post. But specific points regarding them have NOT been mentioned and I hope to make a specific post about that one day Child and Sexual abuse COMPLETELY change a person's perspective of sex and it has to be dealt with appropriately. If you have been abused in any way, there are chances that it has changed/affected you and you don't even know. **Terminology -** Skinship - Any kind of sexual touching Kissing - Lip to lip kissing 1st base - Boob/butt groping 2nd base - Groin groping 3rd base - Oral Home run - Sex Chapter 1 - **When is the right time to start having sex** When you FEEL like it and when you are 100% sure. The first time I had sex, it was crap. I wasn't sure if I wanted to have sex. I was confused about whether I was ready for the act, whether he was the one, whether I'd regret it later. (I went back to the hostel and cried) And guess what? If you're having these kind of thoughts or doubts YOU ARE PROBABLY **NOT** READY. Being nervous is normal. But being unsure or hesitant usually means you need more time. Sex is as *mental* as physical (especially for women), what I mean by this is to PHYSICALLY enjoy sex, you need to be turned on MENTALLY. If you are worried/not sure/not turned on, its not going to be as fun as its supposed to. The above applies to all kinds of skinship. Do it if you are **ready** and want to do it **with the person**. (both equally important) Age usually doesn't matter BUT I strongly advice you to be **older than 18** (no less than 16 please) because being sexually active *does* open up the chances of trauma and I would never wish my 16/17 year old self to experience the same things I did at 21+ (actually I wouldn't want ANYONE and ANY AGE to get trauma but as an older person I was better equipped to handle something like that) You are **never too late** to do any kind of skinship. But **you can be EARLY**. **Do not be pressured into anything! Not even holding hands!** Bollywood shows its okay to forcibly hold her hand and ""Haseena maan jayegi"", that girls are just ""shy"" so if you ""push enough"" itll be fine. NO!

(I learnt this the hard way and I wish you don't have to) If you are in a relationship and your significant other is pushing you, tell them why you aren't ready. Tell them what you feel inside.

"I tried every omakase in Chicago. Here are my top 10 favorites. Hey everyone, I‚Äôve once again tried every omakase in Chicago and wanted to update my previous ranking, which I published here a while ago [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagofood/comments/1b1r3m8/i_tried_nearly_all_of_the_omakases_in_chicago/). In retrospect, I should have waited longer to publish until I had actually eaten at every omakase. Well, I have now, and I‚Äôve also revisited all the others I had previously tried since posting my last list. Just for transparency, the full list of omakases I ate at on top of the ones in the top 10 are Yokocho, Casa Madai, Raisu, Juno, Sushi Suite 202, Sushi By Bou, Kai Zan, Nomonomo Sushi, and Tamu. A couple caveats, as always, before I start giving my thoughts on the individual restaurants. When I am evaluating these restaurants, I am not putting nearly as much stock into the service/experience as many people do when reviewing food. The lion's share of what I care about lies in how good I think the food is. If you're someone that values these things almost as much or as much as the food itself, my ranking might not be very useful to you. Places that had ""omakases"" that were not nigiri-focused edomae style sushiya spots were not considered such as Komo, Kumiko, Q Sushi, Roka Akor, M Room, and NoMI Kitchen. Since my last list, Kyoku Sushi and Sushi | Bar have closed permanently so they would also no longer be in consideration for this list. Since I got this question several times last time, 312 Fish Market is still my favorite spot for a la carte sushi. I don't claim to be a sushi expert, I am just a guy that loves sushi and spends money very irresponsibly on it. Most omakases are generally very enjoyable experiences. If you went to a spot that didn't make my top 10 and loved it, that's awesome. It might not be bad just because it isn't in my top 10, this is a pretty competitive field. Please try restaurants for yourself and form your own opinions, supporting restaurants is the best thing you can do to keep them around. **Number 10. Sushi By Scratch, River West ($185)** Sushi By Scratch was one I hadn't tried yet when I published my last list and many people let me know that it was a huge omission from that list. I ate there twice since then and the experiences were certainly fun. Each time I went, they had a totally different set of chefs preparing the food. I thought they executed really well in atmosphere, service, and showmanship. Sushi by Scratch is probably one of the best versions of a bromakase we have to offer in Chicago. ""Bromakase"" is a term, not a Japanese word, used to describe a type of high-end, often theatrical, sushi dining experience that has become popular, particularly among younger, affluent men. This isn't a bad thing, it makes sense that many people would love this experience. If you are more traditionalist about sushi like I am, this might not be the right fit for you. However, I think Sushi By Scratch is a great option if you are someone that wants to celebrate an occasion with some sushi without having much experience with sushi in general looking to expand your horizons and try some higher end ingredients. If you are looking for something authentically Japanese, I would look elsewhere. Sushi By Scratch isn't trying to be that, they are doing their own thing. **Number 9. Mako, West Loop ($215)** Mako is now Chicago's only Michelin-starred sushiya, so it might be puzzling to see it not even be a top-8 sushiya in Chicago. For the price, it is hard to recommend Mako over any of the places that I have ranked above it. The menu at Mako is certainly diverse and interesting, although it is hard to imagine that you could make nigiri bites any smaller than Mako is. The last time I went to Mako, my chef was only on his third day after working as a sushi chef at BK Park's sister restaurant, Juno. I didn‚Äôt see BK Park during either visit, so I‚Äôm not sure if he still works behind the counter.

"After 10 years, I've been tagged in. Strap in friends, this is a LOOOOOOONG one. There‚Äôs a ton of backstory that I feel like I need to say to help get you up to speed, and I‚Äôm sorry for it, but I feel like you need to hear it so you won‚Äôt be lost. I have been with my wife for 10 years, 4 of it married. We started dating in College, I liked her enough to hitch my wagon long term and I love her very much. Unfortunately, her mother is a horrible person so I‚Äôve had to deal with her the past decade as well. For 10 years, I have watched my MIL constantly break down my wife, gaslight her, berate her, and treat her like a child even though she‚Äôs pushing 30. About a year ago, my wife finally stood up to her and [I detailed it on the raised by narcissist subreddit.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/78p6fn/im_so_incredibly_proud_of_my_wife_for_finally/) I was incredibly proud of her and I still am because it took a lot for her to finally stand up for herself. It‚Äôs been a relatively quiet year from MIL‚Äôs end, but that‚Äôs mainly because we‚Äôve kept her and her husband at arm‚Äôs length. More recently though, more contact has been had for an assortment of reasons. It‚Äôs been a rough summer for our little family unit. There‚Äôs been a lot of good, but there‚Äôs been a lot of stress. I started a new job with much more responsibility than my old one, my wife started a new position as a kindergarten teacher at a brand-new school and was named team lead, we found out in April that we are pregnant with our second child (we find out the gender on the 14th!), which unfortunately lead to an entire first trimester of illness for my wife. We also bought a new house, had to move, our daughter is now a full-blown toddler with all the ups and downs that that entails, and to top it all off, my Wife‚Äôs grandmother (MIL‚Äôs Mother) passed away within the past month. While my wife isn‚Äôt a fan of her mother, she was very close to her grandmother. This death in the family has lead to more interaction with her mother than we originally planned, but the interaction was inevitable. On top of all of this going on, my SIL, the golden child, became engaged, moved to our current town that is about 3 hours away from MIL, and, SURPRISE! She‚Äôs pregnant now too! Since she‚Äôs the golden child, she‚Äôs being pampered and promised things my wife never received when we announced our first pregnancy. Also, the in-laws don‚Äôt even acknowledge that my wife is pregnant again with baby #2. This honestly doesn‚Äôt bother us because that means we don‚Äôt have to see them that often. Unfortunately though, since SIL now lives near us, that means MIL wants to try and slide her way back into our lives. We have been putting off having her parents visit for months, and now that SIL has announced her pregnancy, MIL convinced the SIL to let her come down and buy her things like maternity clothes toys, and other things she never did for my wife. Unfortunately for my MIL, my future BIL hates both her and my FIL, and refuses to let them stay at his house (this is an entire sub-drama in and of itself) so they tried to slllllllllide their way into our guest bedroom by trying to bribe us with buying a grill as a housewarming gift. As they have been on their best behavior recently, we were willing to let it happen as long as MIL behaved. Since I‚Äôm posting on here, I‚Äôm sure you can guess that things went south. As it happens, my wife and my SIL are in a bit of a tiff at the moment. My wife needed help moving into her new classroom and her sister promised to help. The day that they agreed on arrives and my SIL is nowhere to be found. My wife called her up to make sure she was ok, and she was, pregnancy brain kicked it and she just completely forgot. My wife was understandably annoyed but would have gotten over it if SIL would have just apologized. Instead, she got an apology that was reminiscent of something their mother would say. Her ‚Äúapology‚Äù boiled down to ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean to. I‚Äôm sorry, but I ",Caregiver,Pampers,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/9az718/after_10_years_ive_been_tagged_in/

OH the stories I can (and will) tell. For now though, I will stick to the time I worked for a small Catholic newspaper. Now, just a disclaimer, I, myself, am NOT Catholic. But I luckily (well, at first), that did not stop me from being hired. This was both a blessing, in that it paid the bills and I got to do what I loved as the sole Graphic Designer, and a curse, in that I worked with some over the top people, including one that kept trying to ""convert"" me, a woman who was the epitome of being a ""Karen"" years before being a ""Karen"" was even a thing, and a man who was a deacon, who literally spearheaded a campaign with a subordinate of his to gaslight me, and then went on to harass another female worker as well, along with stealing commissions from yet another subordinate. This story involves the ""Karen,"" whom we will call Rachel (not her real name). Rachel had been hired as a secretary and additional receptionist (we were a small office of up to 10-12 people max at any given time). When she came on, she was married and had a child. Like me, she was initially not Catholic, but later became Catholic. I mention this, because it is important in the grand scheme of things. See, the only reason she became Catholic (and she openly admitted this to me and others in the office that WERE all Catholic and had been for most of their lives, if not all), is because she found out that by her and her son being Catholic, she could get the church to foot the bill for her sending her son to a Catholic private school, instead of a public one. She did this because she wanted a private education for her son, but didn't want to pay for it. So she went through RCIA and had him go through RCIC and the whole 9 yards, then told their church that they ""couldn't afford"" to send him to Catholic school and got the church to pay for it instead (Catholic churches will help parishioners that want to, but can't afford to send their kids to Catholic schools, do so by paying for the school themselves, out of the money that has been donated by other parishioners). So she got what she wanted. This frustrated a fellow co-worker when she found out, because she had been their sponsor and thought Rachel had been sincere in her wish to be Catholic. During this time, Rachel made it all but abundantly clear that she only plays ""Catholic"" when she needs to, so as to get what she wants or needs, like that money for the school, but has no intention of actually living the life of a Catholic. Now, I had no intention of living life as a Catholic either, so I can understand that part. But then again, I never had any intention of becoming a Catholic, and they all knew this. Whenever Rachel's son needed to buy books, or get money for extra curricular activities, or lunch money or field trips, etc., Rachel would immediately go to her church's parish office, looking her poorest and most ""vulnerable"" and ask them to cover the amount. And they always did. Again, pissing off out fellow co-worker who was a member of the same parish and had sponsored them. We all knew that Rachel's husband made a decent living, but apparently he either didn't know what she was really doing, or didn't care. Due to what would happen a few years later, I am guessing that he didn't know and thought that his money was paying for the school and all the amenities. Because while their son (who was a nice kid actually. and so was the husband the few times I meant t",Caregiver,Pampers,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/10paued/oop_and_her_coworker_from_hell_the_rachel_trilogy/

"My parents wants to give my sister the earrings my grandma left for me This story is so weird when I (27f) was 20 y/o I was in relationship/fwb situation with a guy (now40M). It was messy, we were on and off for almost 5 years. He was always clear he wasn't ready for a relationship and I was always clear I was madly in love with him. Everytime I got tired of the situation and wanted to leave somehow he convinced me to stay, because love is free, we have so much time together, he wasnt ready to commitment. I asked abvice to my sister (now42f) and she gave me some crappy advice like made him compromise, leave sfuff at his place and basically turn him into a boyfriend until it was to late to him to say no. I never managed to do that because I wanted him to love me as much as I loved him, not trap him. During the last night I spend at his place he said he wanted to try something more serious with me, talked about some dates he planned etc. Only to ghost me forever. It was hard. This was the first person I loved and he treated me like crap. Six months passed and my sister came home, we both lived with our parents, saying she wanted to introduce her brand new boyfriend, she had have ton of boyfriends but she said this was the one, it was a dinner only with my parents at our home so I was excluded and expected to just go out or chill in my room. The day came and while they were dinning I ordered a pizza I came downstairs only to find the guy I was with six months prior dinning with my parents and sister. I was shocked but pay for my pizza and went to my room again to cry. After dinner was over I confronted my sister in front of our parents and begged her to not be with him. To be loyal to me, her little sister. There was no way she didn't know who he was, I had showed her pictures of him, his socials media, where he worked and she even know where he lived, they never met because he didn't wanted to met my family and never introduced his. But she knew who he was and she excluded me from that dinner because she _knew_ She said they met by chance after we stopped seeing each other. She knew how hard that ""rupture"" was, she knew how painful it was to not have even a closure, he just stopped replying, not even blocking me just left me there wondering after 5 years. She knew that during those six months I was still hurting. I know how it was my fault, I was too naive and thought that if I stayed long enough he would be ready for the relationship I wanted and would learn to love me. Stupid, I know. She defended herself saying it was a coincidence and chemistry was there, she loved him and she wasn't going to lost the love of her life, this stuff only happens once in lifetime. When I was in my early twenties I would believe that, however now I know that there are 8 billions people in this world, there's no ONE love of your life, you can find the love of your life multiple time if look for it. My parents sided with her and said I should get over it since we never have a real relationship. One and a half year had passed. I've been excluded from multiple family gatherings because he would be around and my family thinks I will bring negative vibes since I'm still bitter about everything. I have no feelings for him but I feel betrayed by my sisters and my parents, he is just pos on my eyes now. My sister is now six months pregnant, due her age she had been extremely pampered by my parents. She still lives at home and is going to move with him maybe two months after the baby is born. Then they're going to marry. In my culture is normal that if a woman gives birth moves back (or stay) with her mom so the mom will help with the baby for the first months. A week ago my sister's friends made a surprise baby shower I happened to be at home I tried to talk to them, I don't know why, maybe because my sister and I were to close before and I'm sad we're not longer friends.

"The epic Abbey Yung Hair Method update that has been nine months in the making .... (that nobody asked for) is finally here! Confession time - I'm in my late 30's and it's wild to me that I could have been baking a child this whole time but instead I chose half price hair care products. No, the ex that inspired my hair glow up is not back - thank you for your concern. And yes, I still use Pantene sometimes. It's been nine long months since I set out to test and trial the precious few viral TikTok products recommended by Abbey Yung that are actually available here in Australia. I didn't know what I expected out of this process. Nicer hair maybe? Not like hair commercial nice, but actually wearing it down for a change after you wash it nice. For the uninitiated, I have an oily scalp and fine hair that I have coloured every six weeks from mousey brown to copper red. What I *can* say with pride is that my very fussy, snobby, middle-aged European hairdresser is praising the health, condition and shine of my hair for the first time. I have been a regular client of his for over five years, and he has never been this effusive about the condition and health of my hair. Now - have I been completely honest with him about my little experiments? No, and I never will. He has some very strong ideas about home hair care and I have decided to maintain my fiction of 'just using a hair mask every time I wash it now' for the sake of our hairdresser-client relationship. I don't feel great about lying to my Husband in Hair, but a woman must do what is necessary in these troubled times. Also as a disclaimer - I spent all of my own foolish money on this stuff. Brands don't know I exist and this post is definitely NOT sponsored. Where to start? What probably surprised me the most is that many of the products that made a significant difference in my hair were the most affordable. Yep. A [$5 microfibre hair towel ](https://www.kmart.com.au/product/oxx-bodycare-hair-drying-turban-lilac-43413195/)from Kmart has been one of my biggest heroes. I use this to take my hair from drippy to just damp, which is a must when using K18 (more on that later). I also found I've had less breakage since using this towel to partially dry my hair before applying any leave-in product. I'm sure you can probably get cheaper \*and\* more expensive options, but this one has been wonderful for me. I toss it in the wash and then the dryer with the rest of my bathroom towels and it's still going strong after months of regular use. The next thing I observed over time was the one product I reach for when I want great results but I'm either feeling lazy or in a rush. The award for that goes to the humble lamellar rinse. The OG version of this product is [L'Oreal Wonder Water](https://www.priceline.com.au/product/189973/l-oreal-paris-elvive-colour-protect-wonder-water-200ml). L'Oreal also make a [dry hair version ](https://www.priceline.com.au/product/189972/l-oreal-paris-elvive-hyaluron-plump-wonder-water-200ml)with hyaluronic acid. [Garnier make a version too](https://www.chemistwarehouse.com.au/buy/136673/garnier-fructis-hair-drink-pineapple-200ml). I've tried all three and they give the same results, but Garnier has a sweet fruity fragrance that some may not like. To get the best results from a lamellar rinse, I double shampoo (as always) turn off the water in the shower and squeeze out the excess water from my hair. I then scrunch my hair in the Kmart microfibre hair towel mentioned earlier until my hair is just damp. I gather a section of hair in my hand and apply it from my upper mid lengths to my ends and massage it in for 8 - 10 seconds before moving on to the next section. One important thing to note is that this is literally a water in terms of texture, so make sure when holding your section of hair that your hand is directly under the section you are working on. Otherwise you will just end up squirting half of it into the abyss of your shower.

"I'm a Theme Park Mascot. Some Kids just Deserve to Die The costume I was forced to wear as mascot for Derby's Fun Land was not built for warm weather or user comfort. I was sweating profusely as I stood outside in the noonday sun, a silent prisoner in my oversized getup as I put on a fake happy voice, dancing and capering with visitors. All the while, dying inside. This wasn't what I'd pictured when I'd decided to become a character actor. The costume had the oversized head of a cartoon dog whose gaping mouth I peered out from within. The character wore a blue sailor outfit, a blatant rip-off of a popular duck character created by another brand - a fact which I was heckled for constantly. ""Hey, Derby! Duck!"" a little kid yelled, tossing his hot dog at me and staining my costume yellow with mustard across the front. It was the third time that morning I'd been assaulted by a child, which was my cue to take a smoke break. I began stomping away when someone called after me angrily. ""Hey, asshole! My kid wanted a show, where do you think you're going?"" I turned around and saw a red-faced man with a large camera strapped around his neck, wearing a fanny pack and an Ed Hardy shirt. The devil-child‚Äôs father, I presumed. ""Whoops,"" I said, gritting my teeth and looking down at the obnoxious twerp who'd just branded me with mustard. ""How do you Derby-do, little fella? Are you havin' a great day at Derby's Fun Land?"" The kid leered up at me, grinning a gap-toothed bully's smile. ""You wrecked my Derby Dog! Now I want a new one! No! I want an ice cream cone!"" The little snot knew damn well what he'd done. His dad hadn't seen it, but the two of us knew that he'd purposefully ruined my costume with his hot dog, and was now blaming me for it. It was too much for me to handle. Maybe it was the heat. Maybe it was the fact that I hadn't eaten breakfast yet. Or maybe it was just the infuriating grin of that punk kid staring up at me, knowing he could get away with murder. ""I think you're remembering that wrong, little friend. You threw your hotdog at Derby."" ""Hey! My kid wouldn't do that! Don't blame him for your clumsy ass!"" The little boy took a cue from his father and started crying crocodile tears. ""Derby's a big fat liar! He wrecked my hotdog!"" A moment later the guy was attacking me, shoving me until eventually my manager had to come over - his face a frustrating mask of calm. ""What seems to be the problem here?"" ""This punk ruined my kid's lunch, and now he's trying to blame him for it! I should sue you guys!"" Sure, sue me for a hotdog, I thought in my head. Thankfully it had gone too far by this point and I knew better than to say it out loud. ""I'm terribly sorry, sir. Please, follow me this way. Let me take you to our VIP lounge and we'll get you and your son some complimentary refreshments. Looks like you need a refill there, too!"" He pointed at the dad's red plastic cup of beer, nearly empty. The guy finished it off in one long swig and tossed the cup at a nearby trash can, missing completely. ""Damn straight. C‚Äômon Skylar, we‚Äôre VIPs,"" he slurred, before burping loudly. I'd seen this before. Some people tried to make a stink about everything, just to get free stuff. But this douchebag was taking it to another level. Even the kid seemed to be in on it. And they were gonna reward this behaviour? Hell no. I'd never even heard of the Derby's Fun Land visitor VIP lounge. But it sounded bad-ass. And this guy didn‚Äôt deserve whatever pampering he was about to get. I was picturing champagne and caviar, cigars and high-quality porno magazines. My boss looked over his shoulder at me with a glare that said he'd talk to me later, then escorted the two away into a secret door hidden behind a fake tree prop. I followed them, thinking I would give my boss a piece of my mind. If he fired me, so be it. I‚Äôd taken enough abuse. The dark tunnel behind the fake tree was long and lined with ancient brick.

"[Misc] Some thoughts on sheet masks. Not sure if Skincare***Addiction*** will receive this post well, but it needs to be said. **Sheet masks are extremely wasteful.** Everything about a sheet mask is made for one use. The sheet itself is obviously meant to be thrown away after one use. What‚Äôs more concerning is that the packaging that it comes in is not recyclable. Though it might feel and tear like paper, most sheet mask packaging is lined on the inside with a thin plastic film. This is to keep the serum from seeping out of the paper layer. You can neither throw it in with paper products not plastics. It‚Äôs waste that goes to the landfill. **Sheet masks are not very hygienic.** It might surprise you to know that sheet masks are probably the only skincare product that are touched by human hands. Most sheet masks on the market are folded by [hand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjUvaOfQjoc) or by a [semi-automatic machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SFuPoGTq-A). Both of these methods require human hands to touch *every single sheet* . Moreover, when folding by hand, there is a sheet of plastic that helps guide the folds which doesn‚Äôt appear to be disinfected between use. **Sheet mask manufacturing is accused of involving poor labour protections.** Most companies give the sheet mask manufacturing to subcontractors, so none are made in-house. There have been multiple accusations of companies using home labour i.e., making these masks in private homes of the labour, which is illegal in Korea. Luxury and affordable brands alike have been accused of these practices many times in the past few years. [2008](http://enews.imbc.com/News/RetrieveNewsInfo/29995) [2014](https://www.cosinkorea.com/news/article.html?no=8333) [2016](https://weekly.donga.com/BestClick/3/all/11/536977/1) **Sheet masks don‚Äôt need to be wasteful.** There are many DIYs that show you how to make your own. I used [this](https://blog.mountainroseherbs.com/hubfs/FacialMask\_Template%20(1).jpg) template to cut from a muslin cloth (you can use an old cotton t-shirt too!). I soak it in mixture of cold water and a toner of choice, currently it‚Äôs the Laneige Cream Skin. After each use, I throw it in the washing machine and air dry it. Best thing about using muslin is that it gets softer the more you wash it! I won‚Äôt deny that sheet masks are luxurious and pampering, especially when you need a pick-me-up. And that‚Äôs what they are, an occasional treat to self-indulge, not an essential part of a routine. Edit: formatting Update: Thank you so much for the awards, completely didn't see that coming! There's been conversation about including makeup wipes in this post. It didn't occur to me because I don't see them much, if at all, on ScA, unlike sheet masks. I didn't want to be singing to the choir about something that's not really supported here anyway. It is very important to discuss nonetheless. Consumption habits and waste in general need to be discussed more here. Thank you for the positive response. This has been about making people reconsider and starting out with small steps. :)",Caregiver,Pampers,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/gb1l83/misc_some_thoughts_on_sheet_masks/

"The Alpha's Rejected Mate Awakening the White Wolf. Link please? Kaelen was supposed to be my destiny. The future Alpha of our pack, my childhood love, and my fated mate. But one night, I smelled another woman on him--a sickly sweet Omega scent I knew all too well. I followed him and found them under the great oak, locked in a lover's k**s. His betrayal was a slow and deliberate poison. When his precious Omega, Lyra, staged a fall, he cradled her like she was made of glass. But when he sabotaged my saddle during a dangerous jump, causing my horse to throw me and break my leg, he called it a ""warning"" not to touch her. His care for me afterward was just damage control to avoid my father's suspicion. At a public auction, he used my family's money to buy her a priceless diamond, leaving me humiliated and unable to pay. I finally understood what I'd overheard on the pack's mind-link days before. To him and his brothers-in-arms, I was just a ""pampered princess,"" a prize to be won for power. Lyra was the one they truly de**red. He thought he could break me, force me to accept being second best. He was wrong. On the night of my 20th birthday, the night I was supposed to be bonded to him, I stood before two packs and made a different choice. I rejected him and announced my union with a rival Alpha, a man who sees me as a queen, not a consolation prize. Chapter 1 No.1 Aria POV: The night air of the Silver Moon territory was crisp and clean, carrying the scent of pine and damp earth. It was my territory, my home, and one day, it would be my responsibility as Luna. But tonight, all I cared about was the man walking beside me. Kaelen. His presence was a physical force, a magnetic pull that had governed my world since we were children. He was the future Alpha, chosen by my father for his unmatched strength and strategic mind. And, as everyone in the pack whispered, he was my destiny. My heart did a familiar flip as his arm brushed against mine. I breathed in, expecting his signature scent, the one that always calmed my inner wolf--the bracing aroma of a snowstorm breaking over a cedar forest. It was the scent I dreamed of, the scent of my supposed mate. But tonight, something was wrong. Underneath the familiar cedar and winter air, another scent clung to him. It was sickly sweet, like cheap candy and cloying jasmine. An Omega's scent. A scent I knew all too well. Lyra. My stomach twisted into a cold knot. Lyra, the fragile Omega he and the other warriors had been brought in with, the one he insisted on treating like a sister. ""You were with Lyra,"" I stated, my voice flat, betraying none of the turmoil inside me. Kaelen's stride didn't falter. ""She was feeling unwell. I took her some herbs."" His voice was smooth, but the lie was as loud as a scream to my senses. The scent wasn't from a casual visit; it was deeply ingrained in the fibers of his leather jacket, a mark of prolonged, close contact. We continued our patrol in silence, the easy camaraderie we usually shared now replaced by a thick, suffocating tension. When we reached the edge of the ancient woods that bordered the main estate, he stopped. ""I'll finish the southern perimeter. You head back."" I just nodded, unable to look at him. But I didn't head back. A dark premonition coiled in my gut. I circled around, using the cover of the dense woods to shadow his path. My wolf senses, already heightened by suspicion, made me silent, a ghost in the trees. And then I saw them. Under the gnarled branches of the great oak, where pack mates often pledged their love, Kaelen stood with Lyra. Her arms were wrapped around his neck, her body pressed against his. The moonlight illuminated the scene with brutal clarity. He leaned down, and their lips met in a fierce, po**essive k**s that sent a wave of nausea through me. It wasn't a brotherly k**s. It was the k**s of lovers. My world, once a bright and hopeful place centered around him, shattered into a million icy fragments. I didn't make a sound.

"[MISC] The BEST beginner basics I‚Äôve learned on this sub I spend a lot of time on this sub, and the tips that I‚Äôve found here which have had the biggest impact on my skin are honestly SO simple and beginner-level. I‚Äôm talking newbie stuff that I probably could have figured out on my own- and yet somehow totally didn‚Äôt in my 27 years of professionally owning a face. I wanted to share a list of the best ones that come to mind, and invite anyone else to share their most substantial, yet totally newbie-level things they‚Äôve learned here too. So without further ado, here are the single most significant ‚Äúsuper-beginner‚Äù things I‚Äôve learned on this sub that have made the biggest impact on my skincare. ‚Äî‚Äî 1. BLOTTING This is so ‚Äústupid-obvious‚Äù and yet I literally never thought about doing it. I have oily skin, and throughout the day, I would notice the valley between my nose and cheeks getting shiny, but I‚Äôd just sigh and do nothing about it. ‚ÄúAh well.‚Äù I‚Äôd say. Girl. Use a paper towel! Gently tap the area! BOOM! Excess oil soaked up. Shine gone. Makeup and skincare completely safe. And your skin isn‚Äôt rubbed dry or deprived of natural moisture. Genius. Yet so, SO, basic. Brown paper towels in public bathrooms are honestly my favorite for this too, which couldn‚Äôt get easier. Nothing to buy or pack. Since doing this 1-2 times a day when I notice it, I no longer get pimples in the middle of my cheeks. Honestly I feel like a total idiot for never considering this technique, but here I am! So yeah, blotting. ‚Äî‚Äî 2. CHANGE YOUR PILLOWCASE Another obvious thing that I really should have known, (and to be fair, I did, I‚Äôm just lazy and gross I guess) is to change your dang pillowcases! I‚Äôve started to do this once a week, but I‚Äôve seen others on here do it even daily. Think about all the nasty stuff from your hair, mouth, scalp, nose, sweat, bacteria, etc. All being smooshed against your skin for hours each night. Imagine spending your whole routines all day to pamper your skin, and then rubbing your face directly in a dirty gym shirt for eight hours. Plus you‚Äôre giving off heat and moisture, so just picture all the bacteria living it up in the sauna that is your old pillowcase fibers. I‚Äôm super grossed out to admit that I legitimately wouldn‚Äôt change my pillowcases for months sometimes. (Sorry, mom.) But now I know better, and I am thankful this sub helped me realize. ‚Äî‚Äî 3. OILY SKIN NEEDS SKINCARE TOO I legitimately used to be absolutely terrified of leaving anything on my face that wasn‚Äôt immediately cleansed off. I thought EVERYTHING would cause acne, because in my head, I‚Äôd think: ‚ÄúOh I have oily skin. I would not dream of adding even MORE stuff on top. I‚Äôd get so many pimples.‚Äù I hated the idea of moisturizer- it was ass backwards to me. I thought I needed less hydration, not more. I also thought I would explode into full blown pizza face if I put sunscreen on. Obviously now I know these are all totally not true. Oily skin needs moisture, and in fact, moisturizers can help skin become less oily over time as your skin feels less need to over-produce. And everyone needs sunscreen. But the biggest takeaway is just: skincare products aren‚Äôt grease!!!! Don‚Äôt be phobic just because you have this incorrect worry that your skin must be bone dry or else be in danger of breaking out. Obviously some products could give you reactions like this. But skincare in general can be trusted. It‚Äôs meant to make your skin look better, and become healthier. ‚Äî‚Äî 4. SUNSCREEN IS SHINY You‚Äôre probably always going to need powder or a BB cream. Maybe people with dry skin can get away with walking out the door immediately after applying sunscreen, but it‚Äôs honestly not a big deal to be shiny (and in fact probably means good things like you‚Äôre wearing enough!). Don‚Äôt waste hundreds on a dozen different sunscreens to find a holy grail that has it ‚Äúall‚Äù, I.e. no fragrance, no white cast, dries well, non-greasy, tinted perfect shade, moisturizing, affordable, available",Caregiver,Pampers,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/o4dbid/misc_the_best_beginner_basics_ive_learned_on_this/

"Stellaris Dev Diary #385 - AI Benchmarks [written by Eladrin](https://preview.redd.it/r9kiazqeeb2f1.png?width=2108&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=546ca26a83123851c0110f33ecf41da8db01d8b0) Hi everyone! (4.0.13 patch notes at the bottom) We expect the 4.0.14 release will be next week (probably on Tuesday), and is expected to include some fixes to a few infinite loops and some select balance changes (like splitting up Enforcers and Telepaths again). It will be a short work week here in Sweden, so it‚Äôs likely to be the only update of the week. As I mentioned last week, with multiplayer stability largely handled, AI is one of our next focuses. Today I want to talk about AI benchmarks, and have a discussion with you about how we should measure ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù. # What Makes a Good AI? The AI in Stellaris has always been designed as very reactive, and AI personality has a massive impact on their behavior. Our goal is for our AI empires to feel like actors in the galactic play - acting in a manner consistent with their Origins, Authorities, Civics, and Ethics rather than always picking the ‚Äúmeta‚Äù play. They do still need to put up a bit of a challenge though, especially at higher difficulties. The first economic goal we make for our AI is ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt collapse in an economic death spiral‚Äù, and it‚Äôs actually far better at that in 4.0 than it was in 3.x. The current AI does NOT meet the second ‚Äúprovide an adequate challenge‚Äù goal though. One of the fundamental tools we have for our AIs are resource targets in their economic plans. They‚Äôll strive to reach those targets, and many of these are set as ‚Äúscaling‚Äù - if they meet the target, they‚Äôll raise the target the next month. This attempts to ensure that they‚Äôll keep thirsting for ever larger research and alloy numbers (or food if they use bioships!) as is appropriate. This is one of the tools we also use to make them exhibit their ethics - Materialists scale their Research targets faster than other empires, so they‚Äôll inherently be more likely to build more Research specializations, while Spiritualists are more likely to have a lot of Unity specializations. Ironically, improving AI tends to consume any benefits we carved out through performance improvements. The stronger the AI, the more stuff they have - fleets, colonies, and so on. # Benchmarking One way to decide whether or not the AI is performing up to expectations is through benchmarking - what kind of fleet power, alloy generation, and research generation should they have by 2230, 2250, 2300, and so on? Around what year should they hit 10k fleet power? Then there come questions around whether the benchmarks should differ based on personality type. Should it be different if they‚Äôre Democratic Crusaders vs. Peaceful Traders? Or does differentiating them there make the friendlier empires too weak? I‚Äôve got my own set of benchmarks that come from running 3.14 and from the multiplayer community, and in general, I‚Äôm okay with Grand Admiral being significantly harder than it was in 3.14. but I‚Äôm interested to hear what you all strive for. How much research and alloy production do you try to have 10 years, 30 years, 100 years, and when the end-game crisis comes calling? (Include your preferred difficulty settings and galaxy sizes as well if you could, as well as if you change any other important settings like tech costs.) # What‚Äôs Next? We‚Äôre going to continue with 4.0 post release support. Since the next two weeks are both short weeks in Sweden, our next Stellaris Dev Diary will be June 12th. (You‚Äôll be hearing from me in patch notes in the meantime though. -Eladrin) **Stellaris 4.0.13 Patch** # Improvements * Behemoth Fury is now available to Wilderness Empires. * Improved tooltips for the following civics: * Functional Architecture/Constructobot * Environmentalist * Astro-mining Drones * Maintenance Protocols * Ascensionists * Augmentation Bazaars * Brand Loyalty * Death Cults * Dimensional Worship # Balance * Mutagenic Habitability now ",Caregiver,Pampers,reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stellaris/comments/1ksnvje/stellaris_dev_diary_385_ai_benchmarks/

"OOCS, Into A Wider Galaxy, Part 299 [First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/nfsakq/out_of_cruel_space_part_1/) The Bounty Hunters ‚ÄúSomething to tell the boys. They need to update The Brand.‚Äù Harold notes before he suddenly rushes forward. Hafid catches his fist against the flat of his sword, but is sent skidding back either way. ‚ÄúWe were all so concerned with keeping water off us to stop drowning we didn‚Äôt think about techniques like yours.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat was merely my getting into the appropriate mindset.‚Äù Hafid states. ‚ÄúIt is not meant to end fights, although for many it does.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure, because a technique that makes the area dryer than hard vacuum is a simple mindset. I‚Äôve fought Apuk battle princesses with their warfire and it‚Äôs not this dry. You‚Äôre deliberately evaporating water and disguising it with heat.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe heat is usually more than enough. Few have the will to even stand beneath the glare of the sun.‚Äù ‚Äú... You‚Äôve really pushed yourself into thinking you‚Äôre always correct.‚Äù Harold notes as Hafid rushes him and the initial swing of the still sheathed sword is ducked before Harold brings out his own sheathed sword to block the next. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy? Because I must!‚Äù Hafid remarks as he shifts his grip until he‚Äôs holding the sword in two hands for more control. The vaguely falchion shaped sword is the kind of thing that chops and hews into things. But it‚Äôs minimally enhanced and still in its sheath, so there‚Äôs nothing more than a hollow ‚Äòtok‚Äô sound when it crashes into the sheath of Harold‚Äôs sword. ‚ÄúYou are human! You cannot possibly understand!‚Äù ‚ÄúThen explain it to me. Even if I cannot truly comprehend, at least let me know the words!‚Äù Harold says as he deflects a trinity of sword swings then ducks as Hafid extends his wings to try and chop him in the face. His sheathed sword then smacks into Hafid‚Äôs left ankle as the entire sweep of the wings was a distraction to force Harold into a position to get kicked in the face. But Harold is a fast bastard and has good reflexes. ‚ÄúWell parried. And the reason I must use threats, force and indeed a truly unpleasant manner of settling debate and conflict is that I am not respected otherwise. I am not part of a military, I am not some flippant fool gallivanting from place to place with an entire army and a uniform to back it up. I must earn my respect, and most take one look upon my fur and all notion of dignity and consideration is cast to the winds.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy do you care what others think of you? If they‚Äôre so short sighted and stupid as to judge you for what part you play in reproduction then why are you even speaking to them?‚Äù Harold asks as he jabs at Hafir. He‚Äôs still holding onto the sheath of his sword and trying to smack the Sonir with the cap of the handle. They are still being friendly after all. And drawing out his murderously strong weapon and reducing the man into a Rorschach test is far from friendly. ‚ÄúBecause my duties are beyond that of simple violence. It is what I use to remove obstacles and drum up additional funding. But my goal is preservation and conservation. For that I need respect to at least buy sufficient time to clean any damages and reintroduce a broad enough gene-pool of healthy adults to any species that had been laid low by the carelessness and cruelty of people. Failure means extinction of innocent creatures, meaning potential peoples will never emerge and societies will never spin or develop into being. Surely you‚Äôve seen it? Advanced animals on the cusp of some form of personhood nearing the edge of danger?‚Äù Hafir explains as he weaves away from Harold‚Äôs increasingly fast jabs. The two men are testing each other, moving faster and faster as they fight, but holding a clear and easily followed conversation as they do so. ‚ÄúThis conservation is about more than nature?‚Äù Harold asks as Hafid shifts and uses the guard on his sword to tangle with Harold‚Äôs and there is a quick fight over who has control of the weapons.

"First Contact - Disaster - 490 \[[first](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/f94rak/oc_pthok_eats_an_ice_cream_cone/)\] \[[prev](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/n7dvpu/first_contact_disaster_489/)\] \[[next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/n9mrdv/first_contact_disaster_491/)\] The day was warm, with a light breeze that moved across the plains making the grain fields wave slowly. Not that there was the driving need to grow grain there had once been. A simple home nutriforge could keep a family fed with a dizzying array of foodstuffs that were identical to 'grown' food right down to the molecular level. Still, some things, the beings of the Terran Confederacy felt were better if they were 'real' and 'non-forged.' Smokey Cone and the Treana'ad believed that grain and milk, sugar and salt, and everything else that went into the wide array of ice cream flavors, was better if it was 'naturally grown and/or collected' rather than just forged up. Some of the more esoteric and expensive ice creams even bragged such things as ""Genuine Soft Handed Terran Milkmaids"" or ""Genuine Salt Mined by Pickaxe"" and ""Strawberries Grown Under the Light of a Yellow Sun"" for their premium taste and expense. The cattle in the fields, most of which were direct bloodline to the cattle taken by the legendary P'Thok in the Great Moo-Moo Raid almost nine thousand years ago, were lavishly pampered to a degree that bordered on outrageous. Petted, brushed, combed, hand fed, they were pampered out of the belief that an uncomfortable moo-moo would produce sour milk. The Cattle Queen watching over the moo-moo's as they were being brushed and pampered was ostentatious in her lavish outfit. Her dress was styled off of ancient Terran West Cattler style, with plenty of frills and lace, with a bustle that completely covered her abdomen and hid her legs beneath it's impressive size. Napping on the soft cloth of the bustle, basking in the sun, were a half dozen hatchlings smaller than a human's hand. Her bonnet was ornate, hand embroidered, shading her eyes and antenna from the warming rays of the large red sun. She even had a hand tooled leather pistol belt around her thorax/abdomen junction, complete with bullets and an ivory gripped pistol in the proper places. T'Nok knew it was all to show off her power and wealth, not only to any passerby's but to the moo-moo's themselves, to let them feel calm and protected by her wealth and power. He nervously cleaned his antenna as he moved up, guarded on either side by Rigellian females dressed in chaps, boots, and leather vests with moo-moo tender hats. They too had leather gunbelts, only where the Matron wore one, they wore two crossed, with heavy pistols riding in the holsters. The spurs on their leather boots (hand tooled, real leather, of course) chimed softly as they walked. The Cattle Queen Wi'Luki ignored T'Nok at first, reaching out to slowly pet the long nose of one of her moo-moo's that came over to the fence. The moo-moo quivered with delight as the bladearm gently brushed down from the moo-moo's eyes to the wet nose. After a moment it made the low sound they were famous for and ran off. ""Honored T'Nok,"" the Cattle Queen said, her voice almost lost in the sound of the wind. ""My congratulations on your elevation to Citizenship."" ""I thank you, Matron,"" T'Nok said. ""I was surprised to see your request to meet with me. I had thought you were quite busy at this time,"" Wi'Luki said slowly, her affected drawl soft and pleasant to T'Nok's ears. ""I have taken some time off due to personal reasons,"" T'Nok said. ""The Terran,"" Wi'Luki said. It was not a question. ""My brother, yes,"" T'Nok said. The Matron turned and raised one antenna. T'Nok nodded. ""When I attended the University of Lumbering Meat Beasts Crossing Water in Bongistan, I was inducted into an ancient brotherhood that extends to before the Glassing.
