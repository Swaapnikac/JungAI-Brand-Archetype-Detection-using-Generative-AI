Since its inception in 1966, the iconic outdoor brand has always played differently as evidenced in their Athlete Tested, Expedition Proven cultural mandate and enduring dedication to Never Stop Exploring. The “We Play Different” campaign serves as a new singular narrative that will guide consumer and brand communications challenging its customers to defy norms and explore new paths. The North Face’s new brand anthem highlights personal triumphs and milestones achieved by its world-renowned global athlete team and filmed in the world’s most epic and unconventional playgrounds. “We Play Different” not only pays homage to The North Face’s spirit and purpose but also challenges and champions its customers to step into total immersion in the outdoors. Compared to traditional sports that have rules, referees, goals, and white lines that confine them, The North Face views mother nature as its guide and goal keeper. Nature never lies and that’s the beauty of the risk the outdoor brand’s global athletes take on every adventure and expedition. The North Face’s athletes and brand enthusiasts play differently in their approach to exploring places no one else has been, from summits, cliffs, trails, and peaks that began in 1966 on top of an 8,839 foot rock in the Yosemite Valley. This campaign is a celebration of who we are and what has defined our brand for the last 60 years. The campaign portrays human conquest and personal journeys through compelling moments in sports and movement and will be the driving force behind The North Face’s brand narrative this season. The campaign will appear in select media outlets across Australia and New Zealand, and will include You Tube, and an OOH campaign on the streets of Sydney. WORLD SQUARE ‘WE PLAY DIFFERENT’ – OCTOBER 2024 To continue the storytelling around We Play Different, and celebrate the opening of the new format store at World Square, Sydney, The North Face will be hosting 3-days of climbing, breaking down the barriers of climbing and enabling urban explorers to play different. WE PLAY DIFFERENT | THE MANIFESTO Out here things are different. They look different. They feel different. They sound different. You won’t find state of the art stadiums. Only couloirs and canyons. You won’t hear starter pistols or whistles or the roar of eighty thousand fanatics, screaming at the top of their lungs. You’ll find no mascots in animal suits out here. But you might find bears, or wolves or bald eagles. Nature doesn’t play games and neither do we. So out here we play different. We don’t play by the rules, we make them up as we go along. We play hide and seek with convention. We play tag with potential. We play mind games with can’t. We play hooky with the status quo, and hard to get with boring. We play roughhouse with failure, And chicken with gravity. We play and we play and we play. And when we play there’s always a little voice in our head that reminds us why we do what we do. It reminds us why we play the way we play. It doesn’t say much. It doesn’t need to. It says all we ever need to hear. This is going to be wild. We don’t play games. We Play Different."}

It serves as a foundational stone, guiding branding and decision-making with a clear declaration of your company's core values and vision. This vital document not only helps align your team but also communicates your startup's purpose and authenticity to customers, enhancing consumer connection and loyalty. ‍ In essence, a brand manifesto transforms your passionate vision into a strategic asset, steering your startup through its growth journey. A well-crafted brand manifesto not only articulates a startup’s aspirations but also embeds these ideals into the fabric of its culture, ensuring every business decision upholds these principles. ‍ ‍ What is a Brand Manifesto? A brand manifesto is a public declaration that articulates a company's foundational values, vision, and mission, encapsulating what the brand stands for and believes in. It serves as a guiding beacon for the brand's identity , influencing all aspects of business operations and ensuring that every facet of the company reflects these core values. ‍ This powerful document goes beyond mere advertising; it resonates with customers and employees alike on an emotional level, fostering a deep connection and loyalty to the brand. ‍ Unlike a mission statement, which often outlines the day-to-day operational goals of a company, or a vision statement, which projects future aspirations, a brand manifesto combines elements of both and adds a passionate commitment to the brand's values. ‍ It is broader and more emotive, designed not just to guide the brand but also to inspire and rally the people around it, creating a unified sense of purpose and direction. This emotional story not only differentiates the brand in the marketplace but also cultivates a loyal following by consistently communicating the brand’s purpose and standing as a rallying cry for continued growth and innovation. ‍ ‍ The Importance of a Brand Manifesto for Startups Aligning Vision and Operations A brand manifesto is essential for startups, as it ensures every aspect of the business aligns with the company's core values and brand's vision. This alignment is not just about maintaining brand consistency; it's about embedding the brand's values into the very fabric of the company's daily operations, ensuring that everything from product development to customer service resonates with the brand's identity and purpose. ‍ Such strategic alignment helps maintain a clear and compelling brand story that differentiates the startup from its competitors​. ‍ Crafting a Strong Brand Identity A compelling brand manifesto articulates a startup's unique brand identity, which encompasses more than just its products or services—it captures the essence of what the brand believes and stands for. This document should include a powerful vision statement and mission statement that clearly outline the brand's aspirations and operational focus. ‍ By defining these elements, the manifesto helps shape the public perception and internal understanding of the brand's mission, ensuring that everyone is on the same page​. ‍ Motivating Employees and Enhancing Engagement Beyond external communication, a brand manifesto serves as a rallying cry for employees, encapsulating the emotional story that the organization believes in. This internal narrative fosters a work environment where employees are not only aware of the company's goal but are also emotionally invested in achieving it. ‍ By connecting the team's efforts with the brand's overarching purpose, the manifesto encourages a high level of engagement and commitment, aligning personal and organizational objectives for maximum impact. ‍ Building Customer Loyalty Through Emotional Connection A brand manifesto that effectively communicates the brand's purpose and values can deeply resonate with the target market, turning prospective customers into a loyal following.

Those dull paragraphs, filled with vague aspirations of “to help people and businesses throughout the world realize their full potential”* are a way of the past. Today’s customers simply do not have the time or will to care about lofty and overly general objectives. We don’t have the attention to focus on some innocuous mission statement; however it is the brand’s job to make us care, to inspire us, to challenge us, and even to offend us if necessary, as long as you get our attention. Mission statements are engineered to be general yet comprehensive, a statement that essentially stands for everything, which in reality, stands for nothing. Brands that want to set themselves apart will draw a line in the sand. Thankfully, there are those out there who are drawing these lines, and in doing so are creating more specific, transparent, and emotional stories to tell their customers why they exist, what they’re passionate about, and therefore why the customer should care. Enter the brand manifesto, a clear and public declaration of purpose and intent. When done right, a manifesto not only inspires customers, but inspires employees and attracts future talent. This authenticity is no longer negotiable for brands that want to cut through the clutter of their competition. It’s no longer enough to be “different” because customers are inundated with messages from brands trying to be “different.” Apple owns “Think Different” and may have ruined it for everyone else. But that’s ok, turn inwards and be authentic, strip away the marketing speak and bare who you are, even call out the chinks in your armor if necessary, that’s what authenticity is about.

The graphic design and visual nature of the manifesto plays an important role in how each is understood. With the continued growth of image sharing social platforms like Pinterest, the graphic presentation of the manifesto can be half as important as its content.
