So, me and my buddy just booked a spontaneous trip from Stockholm, Sweden to Milwaukee. We love to fish and we would really really love to go out fishing on Lake Michigan. We don't care if it's for perch, pike, salmon or walleye. We just want to go out on the lake. We'll gladly pay for fuel, food and brews but we are not looking for a charter. We are in Milwaukee from 1th of August to the 8th. ***Some of OOP's Comments:*** **warrenj18:** Dm me. I can make it happen if you guys provide the beer &gt;**OOP:** DM sent! **Cordial-Koala:** So curious what has prompted this spontaneous adventure to our fair city! &gt;**OOP:** I wish I could say we threw a dart on a map or something cool but we just looked for the best flights from Stockholm and it was Chicago. Neither of us wanted to stay in Chicago so we decided on Milwaukee, mostly because of the beer history. How can you not visit Brew City? **TallBoiPlanks:** I can’t offer fishing but I might be able to take you sailing on the 1st. &gt;**OOP:** We would absolutely love that but we wont be in Milwaukee before 7 PM on the 1st.

Driving 10 MPH over the speed limit and we were still always the slowest car on the road. Some butt clenching moments were had. We had booked an AirBnb and stayed in The Malt House. A really cool apartment house full of Pabst history and Central Waters Brewery and OnTap right outside the door. It was dirt cheap for some reason. We paid about $90 per night for a 2 bed room apartment with all the bells and whistles. We had e few beers and our first Cheese Curds, which we loved, and took an early night.

I’m not very smart and I hate wearing suits. I’m a boring index-fund guy. After all, history and math show us that the safe path to retirement is to simply plop money into a Vanguard fund every month. And that’s what I do with most of my money. But sometimes I see a juicy opportunity that fires me up. Occasionally, the timing of that opportunity is juuuuusst right and I put real money on the line. This is one of those situations and I'd love to hear what you think about it. I recently bought 4000 shares of Rivian stock (RIVN). My average cost is just over $16/share. That amounts to about $65,000. At the time of this writing, Rivian floats around $15.00/share and has a $14.5b market cap. I might buy another 1000 shares depending on the feedback that I get to this post. Anyway, here is why I believe Rivian will 3-4x in the next few years. # Point #1 – Big Picture - EV’s Will Win… Guaranteed. Over the next 25 years, the auto industry is going to transition to electric vehicles because they will be cheaper to buy and operate. Hear me out: 1. Right now, batteries are the most expensive part of an EV. But EV battery tech is in its infancy. Incremental advances in batteries will increase the energy density and versatility of batteries year by year. More importantly, the industry will scale battery production by a few orders of magnitude. This will make EV batteries significantly cheaper to purchase on a per unit basis. 2. Government’s will continue to incentivize EV purchases with tax credits and other incentives for decades to come. In the long run, governments are definitely going to incentivize large scale energy creation by renewable means (which is getting cheaper and cheaper). On the other hand, western Governments are not going to subsidize or incentivize more coal power plants. That is just a fact. 3. Moreover, gas cars are only going to get more expensive operate because gas is a finite resource. The world is literally running out of oil. We’ve only got like 100-200 years left. So, gas prices are going to go up guaranteed. On the other hand, we ain’t gonna run out of electricity. Humans will continue to innovate and drive down the relative cost of electricity. This is inevitable. I know I’m painting with broad strokes here, but I think any rational mind will agree with most of these assertions. Stay with me. This post gets better as I go… Now, just because EV’s will be less expensive than ICE vehicles in the long run doesn’t mean Rivian is going to win the game. OEM’s like Ford, GM &amp; Stellantis are starting to produce and sell EV’s… right??? Won’t Ford and Toyota and others crush Rivian at the EV game? Nope… not a chance. Keep reading and I’ll show you why. # Point #2 – Pure EV Makers like Rivian &amp; Telsa Will Crush Traditional Auto Manufacturers Ford, GM, and Stellantis don’t stand a chance against Tesla &amp; Rivian. Even if they start making compelling EV’s for customers, OEM’s will be at a long-term structural disadvantage to Rivian &amp; Tesla. Here is why: 1. Rivian does not have a dealership sales model. Dealerships are a useless 3rd party which customers hate. Removing the dealership permits Rivian to sell its vehicles for cheaper than it otherwise could, but also make more profit than it otherwise could. This will be a long-term structural competitive advantage over OEMs. 2. Rivian does not have unions. Unions uniquely harm the automobile industry because the cost of strikes and the cost of artificial wage increases after the strike ends increase the cost of vehicles. The 2023 UAW strike is a good example. If Rivian treats its employees with dignity and respect, they should avoid unionization. This will be a long-term competitive advantage over OEMs. 3. Rivian will make money from servicing and repairing vehicles. In the current OEM-dealership model, the dealership makes more money from the service department th"}

Will the \"outdoor/adventure\" branding and marketing limit its potential? I'm a preorder holder and with the Preferred Stock email that went out this afternoon I've been thinking about the longterm viability of the company post R1T and R1S. Rivian's marketing is somewhat heavy on the idea that it is an outdoor and adventure brand. My thought is that this may be targeting a fairly specific demographic. Also this seems to limit it's potential future offerings to \"adventure vehicles\", meaning, a 4 door sedan doesn't really make sense for an adventure company. I'm aware of the Amazon delivery vehicle deal and that's of course promising, I'm just wondering what you all are thinking about the future of the company and it's potential for non-off-road vehicle offerings. It seems overvalued at $80 billion unless they have a plan to have a wide range of vehicle types in the ecosystem. Has anyone read anything about future vehicle offerings?"}

Relatively new reader, first time poster. Enjoy a little early 90s hobby history. &amp;#x200B; Recently Netflix premiered [Saturday Morning All Star Hits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPAr3-4egRU) a parody of late 80s and late 90s children's programming created by Saturday Night Live alumni Kyle Mooney. In each episode a series of animated shorts are hosted by two radical 90s brothers named Skip &amp; Treybor (both played by Mooney.) Many of the shows parodied in the series are fairly obvious spoofs, for example “Create-A-Critters” is riff on “puffy cheek” plush toy inspired shows like Care Bears and Popples. Also much of much of the humor is based on human failing. Randy for instance is a college aged depressed parody of Denver the Last Dinosaur who binge drinks as a coping mechanism. Skip and Treybor develop a toxic case of sibling rivalry after a voice acting role propels Skip to greater fame and popularity. Meanwhile reality keeps crashing in on Skip &amp; Treybor's neon colored lo-fi world. Cartoon segments abruptly end or become drastically retooled while an OJ Simpson-esc trial begins to interrupt the show. While you don't need to be a 90s kid to appreciate the show's humor what many have missed is that Mooney is satirizing a very specific programming block that marked the death knell for children's animation on one of America's largest and most respected networks. &amp;#x200B; **A Titan In Decline** &amp;#x200B; In the 80s NBC was a major player on Saturday Mornings largely thanks to such hits as Smurfs, Alvin &amp; The Chipmunks, and Disney's Adventures of the Gummie Bears. However by the time 1990 came along the network was in dire straights. The Gummie Bears bounced off the network to ABC in 1989 only to bounce again to the widely popular Disney Afternoon block in 1990. The Smurfs would experience an awkward retool 1989 that sent them on time traveling adventures in an attempt at a season-long serialized story that was ultimately unresolved due to the show's cancellation. In 1990 Alvin &amp; The Chipmunks would become Chipmunks Go To The Movies and spend their last season doing parodies of timely films like Tim Burton's Batman and Robocop. &amp;#x200B; While NBC was slowly losing their strongest shows they were failing to make new hits. Shows like The New Archies and a bizarre animated adaptation of The Karate Kid were outright flops. The network also made baffling decisions. In 1988 an animated adaptation of Jim Henson's Fraggle Rock was canceled not due to low ratings but [simply because a network but simply because a network executive's daughter didn't like the show.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luJr0xLcwsM) &amp;#x200B; Meanwhile the world of animation was rapidly changing. Cable networks like The Disney Channel and Nickelodeon were rapidly gaining ground as cartoons were no longer relegated to the big network's Saturday morning blocks. Warner Brothers and Disney TV Animation were opting to sell their new shows to syndication on weekday afternoons rather than the big four. Saturday mornings were also becoming more crowded. After a rocky start in 1990 Fox was gaining ground thanks to hits like Bobby's World and Taz-Mania. NBC needed something drastic to change the fortunes of their children's programming so naturally NBC's head of entertainment Brandon Tartikoff decided to put all of his faith in two designer jeans salesmen from Canada. &amp;#x200B; **So Who Are these Chip &amp; Pepper guys?** &amp;#x200B; In 1985 twin brother Chip &amp; Pepper Foster began designing and selling T-shirts from the back of Chip's jeep in Winnipeg . 1987 the two launched a line of denim and sportswear that proved to be extremely popular.

As much as its a great all-around platform, I've been feeling the itch to upgrade to something better - problem is I don't know what. This post is 1/2 seeking advice and 1/2 rant. haha. I really love motocamping and have been on week+ long trips all over the American west. A typical trip usually has 1-2 days of interstate driving at 85mph followed by lots of gravel roads and some more remote jeep trails up mountains, across deserts, etc. The CB does all of this \"fine\" but has always felt like a road bike cosplaying as an adventure bike when I go off-road. When I look at my ideal bike, it really shows the hole in the market for a \\~500cc adventure bike which is touring capable but also an off-road weapon. I am really excited about the KLE500 release but also wary of buying brand new models due to teething issues so it will probably be 3 years before I would commit to buying one, and since we haven't seen it, who knows how nerfed it will end up being (BMW GS 450 cough cough). https://preview.redd.it/po94zu0swauf1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=581d75e2ab5ca7cbaf3754bad3aaad89bcf8d6e3 I am always solo and go to remote areas, so reliability and low weight are super important to me. I don't want a bike that can go anywhere, but leaves me stranded. Or one that I dump in the sand, and then can't pull out on my own. So no 500+ pound GS's or KTMs or other bikes with questionable QC, although the 390 adventure R's looks and spec sheet makes me drool. Bikes with sub 500cc engines won't handle interstate speeds here in the US west and dual sports aren't ideal either for that reason. So that leaves the Honda Transalp or Tenere. I've heard the Tenere is uncomfortable to ride all day and the top heaviness and seat height make me lean towards the Honda Transalp. But here's my question: Is the Transalp just a faster CB500x (road biased platform that feels out of place off-road)? How much better will it feel off-road than the CB? Does the greater suspension travel and other off-road features out weigh the greater weight (no pun intended)? If I am being honest, I've never really felt like the Transalp has that cool factor, too. Maybe that would change if I wrung out that hornet engine? Not sure where Honda design went from Rally inspired to minivan inspired. I saw a couple gen 1 Africa Twins in Europe last year, so cool. https://preview.redd.it/thh5rfux0buf1.jpg?width=398&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09eb6b7f360e5d74396dbd265f5a50712c00034e Rant over - I'd love your thoughts!"}

Outside of the Toyota family, there is a case to compare it to another new premium 7-seater, the Jeep Meridian. For its SUV-inspired design, a host of premium features onboard, and expected price, the Toyota Innova Hycross is a fitting competitor to the Meridian. In this comparison of the Toyota Innova Hycross vs Jeep Meridian, we break down the differences and find out which of the two is more suited to your requirements. # Toyota Innova Hycross vs Jeep Meridian: Dimensions &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/z9fppqd4ao5a1.png?width=859&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c02ab6c4933454ddd8b700d63d2b69a979d23a0 &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/l9uyvd25ao5a1.png?width=870&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e93aae96b98bc12a18a2c4bcc208089f5f9c97f While both cars are 7-seaters, they differ vastly from each other in terms of road presence. Though the Toyota Innova Hycross has been given an SUV-inspired front fascia, the side and rear profile is quite similar to that of the Innova Crysta. The MUV has a sedate appearance and looks appealing as a premium MUV. In contrast, the Jeep Meridian is a true-blue SUV and sports a muscular design while still maintaining a sophisticated appeal. The American SUV looks quite similar to its elder sibling, the Jeep Grand Cherokee, which has recently been launched in India. &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/guafb2n9ao5a1.png?width=867&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f8124d75444fca097a371032928b510e93dfff9 In terms of size, the Jeep Meridian is 14 mm longer and 9 mm wider than the Toyota Innova Hycross. However, the Toyota Innova Hycross is 97 mm taller and has a 105 mm longer wheelbase. The longer wheelbase of Innova Hycross can be accredited to its monocoque construction and the front-wheel-drive system. The **Toyota** Innova Hycross is significantly more spacious than the Jeep Meridian, especially in the third row which is usually a critical aspect of a 7-seater. Furthermore, while both cars come with the option to fold the third rows to extend the boot space, the 300 litre of the boot of Hycross with all three rows up, offers better luggage carrying space. The two cars also differ in their layouts, with the Jeep Meridian’s 7-seater layout offering a three-seater second row, while the Hycross’ 7-seater layout offers a three-seater third row. However, this is totally up to buyers preference where they like the three-seater row to be in their cars. &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/rim0gehaao5a1.png?width=869&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e2b8e0efbba6a82cb3551a87af79573d044959f In terms of mechanicals, both cars are built for different purposes and have different advantages over each other. Both petrol power plants of the Innova Hycross deliver more power than the turbo diesel engine of Jeep Meridian, and its hybrid unit delivers an alluring mileage of 21 kmpl. Moreover, the Toyota Innova Hycross is quicker than the Jeep Meridian and can do a 0 to 100 km/hr dash in 9.5 seconds, whereas Meridian can do the same in 10.8 seconds. However, the unavailability of a manual transmission is a limitation and might leave driving enthusiasts wanting more engagement with the car. The Jeep Meridian, on the other hand, generates more torque and feels punchier to drive. What’s more, Jeep is a brand that has always been known for making very capable off-roaders, and the same holds true for the Jeep Meridian. The SUV has been given an all-wheel-drive drivetrain in top variants and 203 mm of ground clearance, to drive through most terrains without any hassle. Unlike the Innova Hycross, the Meridian features a manual transmission, offering more manual control while driving. # Toyota Innova Hycross vs Jeep Meridian: Features &amp; Comfort &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/"}

Hey guys, I'm certainly not a car guy and am looking for a bit of advice. I'm driving the PanAmerican Highway in a couple years(Alaska to Argentina) and I originally wanted to do it in a Wrangler. But when I noticed that a 5 year old Wrangler with 65,000 miles is only about 5 grand cheaper than a new one(and I don't want to take a brand-new vehicle on the trip), I decided a Renegade would be a suitable alternative. My question pertains to the trim level. When I began researching Renegades, I read that the Renegade Trailhawk is the only one that is 'ready' for off-road use. My road-trip will encounter gravel &amp; dirt roads quite regularly, and I also plan on doing a bit of beach driving. I won't necessarily seek out off-road trails, but I'm sure I'll encounter a little bit of that while going off-route. Will the Sport trim be suitable for that? I'm finding a lot of YouTube videos that almost make it seem that the Sport is damn near as capable as the Trailhawk. Could anyone with more knowledge on the subject let me know if the Sport level would be suitable? I'm willing to spend a few extra grand to get a used Trailhawk, but it seems most of the CPO Renegades in my area are the Sport. Thank you, Jeep enthusiasts!"}

One of the main reasons I’m writing this, is because when I was doing research on if I wanted to do an Africa Overland tour or not, there weren’t many reviews or personal accounts of these types of trips to help me decide, I went in blind. And luckily it all worked out really well! Going with an overland tour group saved a lot of headaches with logistics like border crossings, car rentals, corrupt police, etc. Also as a solo traveler, it was a great way to explore Africa with other like minded people, many of whom were my age and also solo travelers (I signed up for an 18-39 year old’s trip, although the mean age was mid 20’s). I did a G Adventures Africa Tour and would definitely recommend them to others. Many other tour agencies (Intrepid, Contiki, Absolute Africa, etc.) do similar routes and I imagine would have similar experiences, with the biggest difference between them being the length of the trips and different types of accommodation and transportation (hotels/hostels vs camping like I did and occasional flights instead of long bus rides). What also convinced me to go with G Adventures over the other tour options, was the 39 year age cut-off. I didn’t want to be stuck on a bus for 40 days with a bunch of couples or retired people, and I thought this gave me the best odds.

I have endeavoured to fill out the details a little, as best I can.* \\---- I made a post previously which described an episode of historical drama which relates to the Star Wars Expanded Universe and, even though the comments started to verge into the usual combative tedium which inevitably afflicts all Star Wars discourse on the internet (all Star Wars fans are incurably incapable of praising anything without tearing something else down, but this is the condition in which we find ourselves and it is as immutable as the fact that all Star Wars fans are inveterate bullies), I think it was reasonably well-received. I will now relate a further story of some odd and occluded background drama from the Star Wars Expanded Universe, and I am pleased to note that this time, it is just a strange little story which involves no overt miserableness. You may, indeed, find it moderately amusing. This is the story of how mysterious legal issues relating to a automotive accessory trademark apparently resulted in a major change being made to one of the most beloved Star Wars games of all time, and might even have contributed to the near-disappearance of a couple of once-significant original characters from the Expanded Universe entirely. **Tales of the Jedi** Our story begins in 1993, an indifferent year for Star Wars. This year saw the publication of *The Last Command* by Timothy Zahn, which concluded the popular Thrawn trilogy and, with it, the first chapter of the new Star Wars Expanded Universe. (Incidentally, this year *also* saw the publication of *Mission From Mount Yoda*, *Queen of the Empire* and *Prophets of the Dark Side*, altogether the second half of the Glove of Darth Vader series, in which a three-eyed slave lord pretending to be Emperor Palpatine's three-eyed son attempts to marry a robotic duplicate of Princess Leia in an Imperial wedding ceremony presided over by a grand moff in a flying Professor X chair reading from a dark side Bible, only to be killed when the robotic Princess Leia shoots him with its laser eyes.) Most significantly for our purposes, though, 1993 brought a new series of comics published by Dark Horse called *Tales of the Jedi* (hereinafter \"**TOTJ**\"), written primarily by the late Tom Veitch in occasional collaboration with Kevin J. Anderson. This should not be confused with the animated series which ran on Disney Plus in 2022 which used the same title (and the same logo, oddly enough); this was a series which forayed into the far distant past of the Star Wars galaxy and told stories about the adventures of the Jedi knights who lived 4,000 years before the events of the Star Wars movies. The comic's second story arc was previewed in [*Dark Horse Comics* \\#7](https://i.imgur.com/Wm1xuAz.jpg) and ran subsequently in TOTJ #4-6. It was called \"[The Saga of Nomi Sunrider](https://i.imgur.com/7xblLGX.jpg)\" and it introduced one of my all-time favourite Star Wars characters (can you tell?) in the form of a young Jedi named **Nomi Sunrider**. As the widow of a Jedi knight who becomes a Jedi herself while raising her young daughter, she is a character who could probably *only* have been created in 1993, when the Star Wars Expanded Universe was in its infancy, artists and writers were taking a few swings and feeling out the setting and seeing what would work and, most importantly, George Lucas had not decided that Jedi could not marry or have children yet. I could talk at some length about wh"}

Guys - I’ve invested in rivian for a while now, and while i’m still a bag holder i am not selling my shares. I’m no where near as smart as some of these Financial guys, but i truly believe in the mission Rivian has. Heres is my Bull case, i like this stock! • Proven product: The R1T and R1S showed Rivian can build premium, capable EVs that stand apart from Tesla and legacy automakers. Owners rave about quality and brand identity. • Scalable future: The upcoming R2 hits the sweet spot of price and market size, expanding Rivian’s customer base well beyond the adventure niche. • Path to profitability: Simplified trims, in-house motors/batteries, and plant retooling drive down costs. Margins improve quickly as volumes ramp. • Commercial anchor: The Amazon EDV contract gives Rivian steady revenue and credibility in the fleet market, with room to grow in broader electrification. • Financial position: While not yet profitable, Rivian has more runway than most EV startups and raised capital smartly. They’re built to survive the shakeout. • Brand advantage: Rivian has built loyalty and lifestyle appeal — positioning itself as the “Jeep” of the EV era. • Valuation upside: After being beaten down, the stock reflects fear more than fundamentals. If Rivian executes on R2, the multiple expansion potential is enormous. R2 is coming, and its going to be great!"}

A small and rugged off-roader made by Brazilian brand, Gurgel Motores. Long post. **THE BEGINNING** Opportunities arise when you are in the right place at the right time. While walking through the Ipiranga neighborhood of São Paulo in 1956, engineer João Augusto Conrado do Amaral Gurgel noticed a lot of activity in a warehouse on Rua do Manifesto: the first Brazilian Beetles were being assembled there, an operation managed by German Friedrich \"Bobby\" Schultz-Wenk. That was the beginning of a friendship that would culminate in a successful partnership ten years later: produced by Macan Ltda., the Gurgel 1200 starred at the 1966 Auto Show with a VW chassis and engine, in the Ipanema, Xavante and Enseada versions, the latter of which was displayed at VW's own stand. It was a four-seater convertible, ideal for leisure. (Post I made about the Gurgel 1200 in this sub: https://www.reddit.com/r/WeirdWheels/s/VtOBCBMWoD) Of the three, only the Xavante prospered: it became an off-road vehicle similar to the Porsche 597 Jagdwagen, replacing the VW chassis with one manufactured in-house, in Plasteel, a steel coated with fiberglass, an invention patented by Gurgel itself. Rebranded as the X-12, it was exported to several countries, establishing the Gurgel name as synonymous with a brave little off-roader that was up for any adventure. **THE TOCANTINS** The first-born of engineer João Gurgel would shine again in 1988: renamed Tocantins, it gained a new front end with rectangular headlights and a cabin extended to the end of the body. The extra 20 cm (7.87 in) guaranteed more space for passengers, but eliminated the external fuel tank and air filter, trademarks of the X-12. The L version, which had a canvas roof, and the TR, with a hard roof, remained, with the latter eliminating the traditional ventilation skylight in the roof in favor of a luggage rack. Another novelty were the beautiful external door handles of the Fiat Prêmio CSL (sedan version of the Fiat Uno, known in other countries as the Fiat Duna). Inside, there were few changes: the dashboard kept the instruments of the Beetle, but replaced the controls of the Fiat 147 (Brazilian version of the Fiat 127) with those of the Gol (small Brazilian car that replaced the Beetle). There were two trim levels: the LE was the simplest, painted in a single color and with seats covered in rough leather. Above it was the Plus version, with colored stripes in a blue, green, orange or gray gradient, as well as an interior covered in gray fabric with red stripes. The tank capacity was increased from 37 l (9.78 gal) to 41 l (10.83 gal). The off-road prowess was maintained, thanks to the high ground clearance, good entry and exit angles and the presence of the Selectraction system, which acted as a selective lock for the rear wheels (in practice, it was a handbrake that locked the drive wheel if it was spinning freely). The powertrain maintained the old and reliable air-cooled VW 1600 engine, coupled to the short-ratio gearbox of the Beetle with a 1300 engine. The intention was clearly to please an urban audience, who saw the small Gurgel as a good option for a cool and easy-to-drive car. To curb its risky behavior on the asphalt, the front suspension received a stabilizer bar and the rear spring load was revised, improving tire contact with the ground. This is the case of this 1991 model, which belongs to São Paulo collector Felipe Olivani: \"The Tocantins was one of the most versatile vehicles in the São Paulo Military Police fleet, especially in the Environmental Command.\" The only change to the jeep was made in 1992, with the adoption of a new front grille and glove compartment with a metal lid from the BR-800 model. Financially weakened after the failure of the BR-800, Gurgel filed for bankruptcy in 1993. In total, 3837 Tocantins units left the Rio Claro (SP) factory until it closed its doors in 1995. The little jeep left no successor and can still be seen in action today, "}

Help me choose. A wonderful wall of text for you all, tldr at the end. Looking at getting my next bike this summer and the list has been narrowed down to these 3. Currently have an XR650L, and while it fills almost the same role as these bikes I want more range (I have a big tank and it’s not enough plus puts a lot of weight high up), a 6th gear/better road manners, and most importantly fuel injection as I ride in Colorado and the altitude changes wreak havoc on getting the carb to act right. Been riding street for 7 years, only had a dual sport for 1 so I’m still relatively new to off-road, but loving it. Use case is going to be riding highway up to mountain trails, mostly jeep trails/ 2 track and generally exploring with some single track sprinkled in if I’m feeling like it. Eventually doing BDRs and such. Would also occasionally commute on the bike but I’m looking at also grabbing a street bike again dedicated for that and road fun (god I miss my sv650). Here’s the thoughts I’m having with the bikes in order for which I think is best for my situation. I know the Kove and 701/690 have been compared before but haven’t seen the new 390 ADV R in many discussions with them, on paper they fill a similar role, at least to me. My budget is about 10k + whatever I get for selling my XR (probably 2-3k) but I can stretch a bit. First place: KOVE 450 Rally Pros: Great fuel range, Low dry weight and center of gravity (the big tank on my XR makes it feel very top heavy, which I’m trying to avoid on the next bike), Love the rally look and fairing, Seemingly great suspension from reviews, Decent aftermarket and community knowledge so far Cons: China (lot of people saying it’s very well put together but I think the highest mileage I’ve heard so far was around 3k so long term still a bit unknown), Tariff situation may make parts harder/more expensive to get Second place: 2025 KTM 390 Adventure R Pros: Bit cheaper than the Kove, Close to same power as Kove, Better electronics package (quick shifter, cruise control, ride modes, but not super important to me), Rally style and fairing Cons: Current KTM situation, Suspension specs not as good as the Kove, Less range than the Kove, Sameish wet weight as the Kove with a big tank up top (possibly more top heavy), Brand new model and made in India (kinda unknown long term but going off the old 390 engine should be fairly reliable… for a KTM), Also, so new that there really no aftermarket for it yet and the KTM situation makes it unknown if enough will get sold to even create one, Most importantly I hate the color orange Third place: 701/690 enduro Pros: Moar powah baby, Proven design, relatively reliable, Most people’s unicorn, Light-ish weight, tank under seat keeps center of gravity low Cons: Price, Price to get it set up on top of the base price (rally tower/fairing, larger tank, etc.) add like $4-6k from what I’ve seen, Again the current KTM situation, Might be too much for me off-road but I can use a gentle wrist if I need to, Did I mention price yet? Holy crap this is an expensive dual sport, I would have to slow roll the necessary items for me as I budget upgrades over a few years which means it wouldn’t be the bike I want from the start like the other two and would not allow me to get a street bike too Honorable Mentions: Crf-450rl - short maintenance intervals, low range, expensive, my first runner up but costs as much as the 701 to get it where I want it in the end and at that point I choose the 701/690 for the extra power. CF Moto 450MT - too heavy, not off-road focused enough Drz-4s - 5 speed, down on power, low range, lack of wind protection options AJP-PR7 - not street legal in the US (to my knowledge) and very little aftermarket/parts support Any of the “street legal dirt bikes” are out for low range and not being tolerable on the highway as well as low service intervals. Any carbed bike is out, I’ve cleaned my current carb enough times for"}

I was torn between the Como and the Vado but am beyond pleased with the decision. I am a fit 60 year old and wanted to buy a bike that would still be the right bike 5-10 years from now. I made the move over from a Trek Marlin 6 and the lack of the mid bar and new riding position are what I hoped they would be. The first couple times I stopped I almost dropped the bike as I was used to resting my leg against the bar. Oops… no bar. Rookie mistake. Also, going over a curb in new construction I dinged the crank when it bottomed out and didn’t have my foot/feet up. Rookie mistake 2.0. Won’t be doing either again and have already been conscious to have the outside foot down on turns to avoid catching the crank. Pluses Price. Yes. With the new models on showroom floors I got this one for $3199 CDN. Great buy considering what the original MSRP was when the bike came out. Whenever we make a purchase we purchase while keeping the the likely life of the product in mind. We amortize the purchase over that expected life cycle. Is it nice to be young? Yes. Is it nice to be at an age in life to be able to afford things that aren’t part of a constant upgrade cycle? Yes. Before you assume we are flush, I drive a base 2015 Jeep Cherokee and my wife drives a 2023 Toyota RAV XSE hybrid. Hardly the luxury models some of our family and friends our age drive.This was a purchase we saw as something worth premium branding and more importantly something we can do together. The build quality and quality of components are premium. I know people with the cheap e-bikes and there is literally no comparison. From the quality to the execution… even something like cable management and routing, far superior. All of the components are quality name brand which to me is both a plus and piece of mind.The fenders are just so great. The brakes are top notch. I find the saddle comfortable and supportive. I had a gel saddle cover the one on the Marlin 6 but no need on the Como. Today’s ride was over 1 hour and 21 minutes on a paved path that circles our city that is about 24-25km in distance (called the Rotary Trail shout out the the Rotarians), and my rear end was fine. I got the bike last Saturday and took daily rides of 14km to 16km (except for yesterday when I got home late). Zero discomfort while riding or afterward. And the suspension seat post… a huge plus. It absorbs the bumps but doesn’t travel so much or so often that the ride seems jittery; I love it. Same with the front forks. Well paired to mainly riding on paved paths and streets. The headlight and tail light are both bright, and living in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, Canada, this time of year I ride after supper when it is approaching dusk so they are a must. The hand grips are very nice as well. The 1 by with 11 gears is plenty and the shifting mechanism is very nice( a new style to me). The battery appears to be strong. I only use the motor when hill climbing or into a head wind so most of the daily rides were 2-4% battery use. Today’s 24.5km ride only used 5%. I should get decent range out of the daily rides. I am doing the first charge while writing this post. The motor is stone silent and seems like part of the peddling motion. Nothing mechanical or weird about it. Very very nice indeed. The iPhone app and software on the on bike computer are exceptional. I need to figure out how to enable Find My for my iPhone but other than that smooth sailing. I find the data between the specialized app and the Apple Fitness app to be rich. The riding position. This was the aspect I was most concerned about but I find the body, arm, and hand position to be very comfortable even on the 1 hour 20 minute ride. I know this is very much a YMMV thing, but for me I like the higher vantage point for sightline and see it as a plus, and I find nothing about the body, arm or hand positions to"}

Hey y'all, just figured it couldn't hurt to ask a question here. So I'm looking into getting my first-ish manual transmission vehicle. Little background info... I actually had a little manual ford ranger years and years ago, I was talked into/forced into buying it by my mother. Threats were involved (Get a car or I throw your 17 year old ass out of the house. She's gone, none of us ever could figure her out) and my grandpa was \"Oh Tina, this truck is so great that if he doesn't buy it **I** am going to buy it.\" So I did. But the catch was, the engine had blown up or something and been replaced. Now I'm not a mechanic, but my Grandpa and Uncle are. So, deal was, I bought it because they told me to, so they had to fix it. And thus the battle of the hydraulic clutch began. Turns out that in this part of Ohio, you can get a new clutch no problem...but you couldn't get the hose.... So while they were facing that battle, I was with mom, learning how to drive a manual. No problem I was told, as my grandpa had taught both his kids manual, and had/has a foolproof teaching method! (He also threw my mother out when she was 16. I bet you'll never guess the reason. Internet super-cookie for anyone who can. Hint, it has nothing to do with anything XXX or drugs) So she got one, we got inside and as you can guess, I stalled out the first time. And the second time. Almost had it the third time. Got it on the forth, but stalled out shortly thereafter. At which point, Mother dear settled on her tried and tested *screaming at you* method. This did not help. At which point she threw me out of the car, took over driving, and left me on the side of the road in a cloud of dust. I stood there like a big dumb 17 year old, until she came back 20 minutes later with a roar of \"See how god damn easy that was?!\" No. No I did not. For I was standing on the side of the road Mother.... Back at Castle Grandpa, the 2 Hay men were locked in battle with a Ranger. A Ranger that refused to be defeated. So after blowing off every hydraulic hose they tried, it ran for 15 minutes and then never started again. Thus declaring itself the victor. Thus ended my time with a manual transmission, and started my weird wacky adventure of going through 4 different cars before I ever got to drive a single one of them. Now, many, many years later. I find myself with a 2019 Ford F-150 STX and a job where I do a *whole lot* of driving. I got the truck due to the fact that I live in an area that can get some **Monstrous** snowfall (This year we got 3-4 feet in a day), and a block of snow in an otherwise clear freeway took my Honda Civic right **TF** out. So, 4 wheeled drive and higher off the ground seemed like a good idea. Now I don't precisely need a new car as I've been blessed with little to no mechanical problems with my truck. I just kind of want one. It's also got 108 thousand miles on it, and I question how long I can be so lucky. But I big problem I keep running into, other than the fact that manual is somewhat rare nowadays, is all the vehicles to choose from these days seem to be saddled with very small engines with turbos slapped on them. Now, again, I'm not a mechanic (Welder by training that I've barely used. Sad world) but when I hear \"2.0 liter I4 turbo\" engine on a big ass truck, I'm skeptical. A turbo four-banger on what's supposed to be a big badass machine? Not to mention that just getting to manual transmissions means you have to go up \"Trims\" that cost tens of thousands more. Now I'm at a bit of a loss. I know about the Honda Civic Type R. I'm also aware of the Ford Mustang GT Fastback with it's big V8 engine. When I was a kid, V8 was all the talk. Where would we go from there? Kids would whisper about V12? V16? What would science cook up? Inline-4 with a turbo apparently kid. I also found what appeared to be a nice 2015 Jeep Wrangler with a 3.6 liter V6 engine. Be still my heart, when 3 liters and 6 cylinde"}

It ravaged the USSR and many of its people, just like it ravaged Afghanistan and fuelled fires of hate, extremism and division that still burn to this day. There were a great many things that separated politics and personal perceptions at that time and immediately afterwards, and it remains a conflicted and painful subject for very many Russians to this day. None of this, in my opinion, diminishes his work; he had unprecedented access to the Army, was included on many military operations and reported, literally, from the front lines. As well as his detractors, he has many, many friends from that era, not least the ex President of Ingushetia, Ruslan Aushev, who was so instrumental in negotiating the rescue of some of the hostages in Beslan (again, amongst the roll call of greatness that is his life) and is at a restaurant table right now, with my Grand Pap, lifting rounds of vodka to help him celebrate. Na zdorovie! He has published a great many things in his lifetime and after he came back from that war, alongside my Grandma who worked the entire time by his side as the cultural correspondent from Kabul, they returned with a huge archive of stuff that, due to censorship, was never to be seen. A few years after their return, the dacha caught fire due to some faulty electrics on the neighbour's side (!?) and the entire archive perished. Something I'd love to do is get his work to be seen and published in English - so I guess this is the first step towards that end! I'm graduating from lurker with this post - so, please, be gentle... and I am looking forward to what y'all are going to have to say about it :). If I've unintentionally ignored some sort of Reddiquette, I am guessing you guys will let me know...Here goes! Original article here: http://esj.ru/2009/03/03/mihail_lecshinskij_vojna_zakonchitsja/ My translation here: The War Will Finish on Wednesday by Mikhail Leshchinsky EDIT: SOME PICTURES FROM THAT TIME HERE: http://manelli.imgur.com/all/ Yes, yes, everyone knew it with certainty, knew it even as far back as 10 months prior to that very Wednesday - 15 February 1989. In retrospect the reason was simple: by this date, set by mutual agreement between the USA and the USSR, every last one of our soldiers had to have left the country. And so it was the last Monday before that fateful Wednesday. A day, remarkably warm and sunny even for an Afghan February. In the almost deserted AFSOR settlement on the banks of the Amu Darya River, there were less than 10 of us in total. AFSOR was the largest outpost of the Soviet-Afghan Action Transport Company. The outpost – two dozen small, Finnish looking chalets. And us - we were the correspondents of The Central USSR Broadcasting Television in Afghanistan; Boris Romanenko and me, Artem Borovik - a journalist from Moscow and our military driver Serezha, designated to us with his Soviet made jeep for the duration of the evacuation. This little group had only formed the evening prior, having arrived to the bordering city of Hairaton together with the last column of our troops. At that time it consisted only of General Gromov's detail and his protection unit. This was the battalion set to officially mark the exit of Soviet troops from Afghanistan, even though by this time almost the entire army had with"}

Stellantis made a great choice, as the did with Kuniskis at Ram. That being said, Jeep has to have a reckoning on it's out of touch pricing structure. Jeep made its bones on being a dependable \"every man's\" adventure vehicle-oriented company. I have owned Jeeps since I was 16 years old. Thirteen Jeeps in total. 40 years later, I still have one. As with the vast majority of Jeep enthusiasts, I couldn't wait for a V8 Wrangler. But, as with most, once the prices were announced, I was disappointed and disgusted. Please consider putting a 5.7 in it, dropping some of the unnecessary luxury nonsense, and pricing it at around the $60k market, and win back your base! I know I am far from alone in this. I know Mr. Broderdorf and his people lurk on these Jeep pages and are taking note of what we all have to say."}

Do anything. Unless you have a warranty issue. Until this experience, we’ve loved our Jeep and being part of the Jeep community. Wranglers are known as the vehicle to “Unleash adventure. Go anywhere. Do anything.” and our family set out to do just that on a 32-day road trip spanning over 7,000 miles from Michigan to Washington and back. Unfortunately, just 1,500 miles in, on June 23 in Rapid City, SD, our Jeep let us down. A failed battery, covered under warranty, sidelined us. The replacement part? Initially expected to arrive in a week and now not expected to arrive until July 17, nearly a month later. We contacted Jeep Cares and were given a case number… but no answers. No guidance. Just the promise that a case manager would reach out sometime after 24 hours. So we were left with two choices: 1. Cancel the next portion, potentially all of our trip, incurring a domino of cancellation fees. 2. As the dealership had no vehicle loaner options for us, rent a vehicle and pay out-of-pocket to continue our once in a lifetime journey. Eventually, Jeep’s offer of support? $50 a day toward a rental. In today’s market, that’s barely a dent and they reminded us “they don’t even have to do that.” There was no offer toward lodging. No meaningful effort to make things right. This response stands in stark contrast to other automakers, like GM, where providing a rental during warranty-covered repairs is standard. Now we are 2,200 miles from home without support from Jeep. We don’t feel valued. And we certainly don’t feel that this experience reflects the Jeep brand’s message to “unleash adventure.” Disappointed doesn’t quite cover it."}

Realistically, it will continue on its current path until the movies are no longer profitable, go extinct for a few years until the inevitable reboot. Let’s assume the movies will continue (whether or not they should), where can they go from Rebirth? Nowhere interesting. I posit they should go backwards (for at least one movie). The next film should take place in the most interesting era of the franchise, directly following the original film. Isla Nublar is the most interesting setting in the Jurassic franchise, as evidenced by Jurassic Park and Jurassic World and the beginning of Fallen Kingdom. We don’t need more secret research islands or stations, we have the original park. Is this nostalgia bait? Of course it is, I’m working with what I’ve got here. Set the film immediately following the original and follow a rescue team onto the island. How does anyone know Nedry isn’t alive at the end of the original film? Were other staff unaccounted for when the island lost power? It would be really cool to see a team of pros walk past the destroyed jeeps and search the island showing us familiar locations from new angles. I would make this a horror film similar to Alien. No need to bring in legacy cast members as they are not age (or plot) appropriate. Make it a small cast getting picked off by dinos one by one like Alien or Predator. No hybrids or locusts or globetrotting adventures, just a moderate budget dinosaur horror movie. No A-list cast needed. Throw in Timothy Olyphant as the team lead/hero and you’ve got a stew going. This does not solve the long term problem of the brand, but it does reset the current trajectory and opens the door to smaller stories. Thank you for reading, I can’t wait to learn why you hate it."}

Each era of ownership has shaped Jeep’s DNA, sometimes with innovation and sometimes under real financial strain. Here’s how the journey unfolded, and why Jeep’s survival is remarkable in the turbulent world of automakers. Everything began in the early 1940s with Willys-Overland, the Ohio manufacturer that brought the first military Jeeps to life. Willys-Overland churned out many of the Willys MB vehicles that carried American troops across Europe and beyond. After the war, they adapted the battle-tested design into the first Civilian Jeep—the CJ series. In 1953, the Willys brand was struggling to compete. Kaiser Motors, who had experience in both wartime and peacetime production, stepped in and acquired Willys-Overland. The company became Kaiser-Jeep. This era saw expansion beyond the military and farm markets. Civilian Jeeps matured, the Wagoneer was born, and Jeep began to look like the go-anywhere SUV icon we know today. By 1970, Kaiser-Jeep was sold to American Motors Corporation (AMC). AMC was a mid-sized US automaker always on the hunt for something that set it apart from the giants. Jeep was their ticket. AMC helped Jeep move forward, developing the Cherokee—a model that would define an era and kickstart the SUV craze. The XJ Cherokee changed the game with its unibody design, blending classic styling with improved comfort and capability. AMC also oversaw ambitious international partnerships, including a joint venture with China that marked a milestone for the global automotive industry. But AMC faced tough times, so in 1979, French automaker Renault stepped in with investments and influence. Renault brought new designs and some European flavor, but the heart of Jeep remained American. The brand was now not just about rugged capability but also about style and family life. Fast forward to 1987 and another major shift: Chrysler Corporation purchased AMC, snatching up Jeep as its crown jewel. Chrysler invested heavily in Jeep, redesigning the lineup and pushing the Grand Cherokee into both suburban driveways and rugged trails. Under Chrysler, Jeep transitioned from a utilitarian survivor to a brand mixing luxury and adventure. Chrysler itself went through a wild ride, merging with Daimler-Benz in 1998 to form DaimlerChrysler. The German-American partnership promised innovation, but cultural clashes hampered lasting progress. In 2007, private equity firm Cerberus Capital bought Chrysler, leading to another challenging period as financial turmoil shook the auto sector in the late 2000s. Salvation arrived in 2009 when Fiat Group, the Italian auto conglomerate, reached a deal to merge with a struggling Chrysler. The resulting Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) era brought renewed investment, global ambition, and fresh models like the Jeep Renegade and modern Gladiator truck. Jeep’s reach exploded internationally. The new owners poured resources into manufacturing and marketing, sending Jeeps to fresh markets in Asia, South America, and Europe. Classic models like the Wrangler also got updates for changing times, all the while keeping their off-road core. Most recently, in 2021, FCA merged with PSA Group of France—makers of Peugeot and Citroen—to create Stellantis, a global automotive giant. Jeep is now a global brand, leading the adventure segment across continents and preparing for an electrified future. Yet through all these changes, Jeep’s personality stayed consistent: freedom, adventure, capability, and a certain rebellious charm. Decade after decade, Jeep endured corporate takeovers, mergers, bankruptcies, and reinventions. Wherever it landed, engineers, designers, and loyal fans kept the roots intact. Every new owner brought big changes—new factories, new markets, fresh technology, and ambitious investments. Yet the core ide"}

Background For several years I have ridden what are branded as \"adventure/touring\" motorcycles (Kawasaki Versys, Suzuki VStrom, Can-am Ryker Rally). All across US and Canada over 10s of 1000s of miles. Mostly 2 lane roads, gravel, dirt, with the occasional water crossing and rutted roads. And interstate, although I avoid 95% of the time. I have turned to wanting to recreating these same types of adventures and routes, but with a VW Beetle. I want to make a Baja Bug (looks and function), but not to the extreme of actually baja-ing it. Riding the same roads the above motorcycles ride. (They were equipped with more aggressive tires and have 4\"-6\" of ground clearance.) Most everything I read is to get a 69+ standard/classic beetle and not a super beetle due to the strut suspension. So in my area, classic beetles are tough to come by. They're either nice with a price of $8000+ or less than $3000, but are usually trashed rust, all kinds of things the owner says needs fixed (easily). /roll eyes. A super beetle on the other hand are plentifully and are in the missing price range $3000-$7500 which is where I want to be, but maybe I'm foolish. Both for the price range and considering a super. So, would a super beetle be terrible for what I want to do. Give it the Baja Bug look (high fenders, larger AT tires) and still do the roads mentioned and travel across US/Canada. A true touring adventure rig. I feel like when mentioning a super beetle in the community is like when Jeep people say you can't wheel a IFS Jeep cause it'll explode as soon as you take it off pavement. And real world advice, pro/cons is appreciated."}

Hence, please allow me to share the right information as a Trekking Guide working here in Nepal regarding the Everest Base Camp Trek. By the end of this article, I assure you would be more confident to tackle this amazing hike by yourself if needed be. [Taken from Kala Patthar \\(iPhone 15 Pro Max\\) - Late December 2023](https://preview.redd.it/ukh6bw3xezdf1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30b1f144430455cda3ee13a4f93ca662d54fc68b) **Introduction** Everest Base Camp Trek is a classic trek that takes you the Base Camp of the World's Highest Mountain, the Mt. Everest. This classic trek generally starts with a Flight to Lukla either from Kathmandu or Ramechhap depending on the Government's decision. However usually in peak seasons, you have to make your way to Manthali Airport at Ramechhap and undertake the flight to Lukla. This short 25 minutes flight would take you the fabled Lukla Airport from where your hike begins. **Transportation - Getting There** To do this trek independently, you have to arrange with an Agency for the Flight Tickets as I have observed it is rarely sold through official airlines website and mostly sold out or reserved by agencies. The cost of the flight is 210 USD one way, so expect about 420 USD for Kathmandu - Lukla - Kathmandu flights. **Alternative Transportation Options** * **Jeep to Salleri and another Jeep to Surke and Hike to Phakding** With the fairly recent road connectivity up to Surke, you can also take the Jeep to Salleri from Kathmandu and embark on a proper off road adventure to Surke from Salleri. There are provision of Shared Jeeps to Salleri and on to Surke. If you have a fairly larger group (4-5 pax), you can take this option as its more economical and reliable. However, expect about a day of drive to Salleri on Day 1 and another day to reach Surke with a late hike to reach Phakding on the 2nd day. * **Heli In to Lukla** You can also avail shared Helicopter flight to Lukla if its feasible for you. There are some operators who collect individuals and arrange the Lukla Flights at about **500-600 USD per person** in high season. Though I have definitely heard stories about trekkers getting really lucky and paying even less or at some cases, charged higher than this price. Usually, flight cancellations over multiple days sees the surge in helicopter fares. For coming out of the region after the trek, you can follow the same transportation options. Use the road route, flight or heli-out options. **Everest Base Camp Permits** As of writing this article, you would only require following permits to visit the Everest Base Camp, **1. Sagarmatha National Park Permit - NRs. 3000** **2. Rural Municipality Permit - NRs. 3000** You can get these permits **at Lukla before your descend to Phakding at the end of the villag**e or **at Monjo at National Park entrance gate.** The documents that you should have are - **Copy of Passport along with original** **P.p. size photograph (1-2 pcs)** You would be provided with a Trek Identity Card with a NFC Tag with your details that needs to be shown at different checkpoints where they would make the entry. **Connectivity and Internet** I would suggest you to go for sim-card from **NTC (Nepal Telecom)**. It has got more remote coverage and depending on the times of the season, works up to Dingboche with proper 4G connection. There is reliable data connectivity when 4G connection is active. However in high season, for some reasons, the 4G Connection stops working making the Trekkers and the Trekking Staff more reliant on **Everest Link Wi-Fi cards** that they sell at the Teahouses which costs as much as NRs. 800- NRs. 1000 for 10 GB and 24 hours usage time. I have always been vocal about this discrepancy but the service pr"}

As someone who frequently dives into the world of audio equipment—especially setups for multiple environments like boats, UTVs, and jeeps—this speaker system has genuinely caught my attention. From its marine-grade build to the crisp sound quality, it seems to have been built with outdoor enthusiasts in mind. But, of course, no product is perfect, and throughout my use, there were a few quirks worth noting. **Build Quality and Rugged Design** Durability was one of the first things I inspected. The speakers are encased in a tough molded casing with a rubber surround, and they’re IPX45 waterproof. Taking them through some rain-soaked trails in my UTV didn’t faze them one bit. They shrugged off mud, dust, and water splashes without compromising on audio performance. Even mounting them on the roll cage of my buddy's boat was a breeze with the universal mounting brackets. However, the mounting brackets, while sturdy, felt like they could be a little more user-friendly during installation—tightening those screws may require some patience. **Audio Performance: Clarity Meets Punch** I was genuinely impressed by the sound this system produced—1000 watts of sheer audio power wasn’t just a number. Testing on an open trail was where the speakers really showed off. The bass carried over the roaring engine of my ATV, and the clear highs from the neodymium tweeters made vocals pop in every track. Despite being in harsh outdoor conditions, sound clarity wasn’t lost, even when the volume was cranked up. The two-way speaker design, combined with a polypropylene cone and butyl rubber surround, delivered a surprising level of depth. **See Pyle PLUTV52CH deals on Amazon now.** **User Versatility and Everyday Use** What I appreciated was how versatile this system is. Whether mounted on a boat for a quiet lake trip or attached to a jeep for off-road excursions, it adapted effortlessly. The 2-inch aluminum brackets supported all mounting needs for different vehicles. The compact marine amplifier added an extra level of control and power, though I occasionally found the wired connections a little cumbersome. If Bluetooth capability had been included, it would have been a game-changer. **Highlights** • Dynamic 5.25-inch speakers with crisp audio and strong bass. • Universally mountable on multiple vehicles like UTVs, boats, and ATVs. • Rugged waterproof design capable of withstanding harsh outdoor elements. • 2-channel marine-grade amplifier with impressive protection circuitry. **Shortcomings** • Mounting brackets could be a bit more intuitive for installation. • Lacks wireless connectivity options like Bluetooth, limiting modern usability. **Connection Options and Features** The inclusion of a wired RCA input was a fantastic touch for those who like a retro approach or need to connect analog devices. I ran it through my MP3 player and even a projector during one backyard gathering, which actually became a huge hit. The integrated wiring harness ensured the setup wasn’t overly complicated. However, it’s worth noting that its reliance on a wired connection might feel restrictive for users looking for more modern connectivity like Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. **Product Competitors** I’ve compared this with a couple of other marine-grade audio systems from brands like Boss and Rockford Fosgate. While Boss systems offered competitive sound quality, they lacked the same rugged outdoor build as the Pyle PLUTV52CH. Rockford Fosgate’s pricier models delivered better detail in sound, particularly for audiophiles, but at almost twice the cost, depending on the setup. For most users, the Pyle system delivers better value when you prioritize outdoor durability and power over minute audio nuances. **Affordable Quality Evaluation** While the price point may initially seem like a splurge for some users, the"}

I sold my home, one car broke due to his negligence and he talked me into selling my jeep and also talked me into a trash jeep I didn’t really want but he swore he would due the work on it (he never did) I gave him the money from my taxes and my house sales for the down payment for a home he bought, we got engaged etc. Long story short, he wanted a whore, a maid and a yes sir anything you say sir, girl. We broke up after 2 years. (It’s worth saying I suffer from treatment resistance major depressive disorder and bipolar2) I had to leave the house. I gave my girls the choice to stay with me or move with their dad who is more stable. They chose him. Well the younger one did then he also convinced the older one, and while it sucks and hurts alot everyday I know he’s a really good dad and him and I get along fine. Anyway. I found an apartment. It didn’t last long, I couldn’t afford it and I lost it. I moved in with a man who I swore was going to be my husband 8 months later. Long story short. He was abusive, selfish and anytime I tried to leave he made it so my jeep was no longer drivable by intentionally messing it up as well as ripping out the tire valve stem in pure rage while I was trying to drive away. Another long story short there, I finally called my best friend to pick me up after he smashed my brand new iphone 16. He’s lived in the town his entire life and the police are no help. Now I’m at my friends house staying in an extra bedroom with very little of my possessions and the worst part is lack of transportation. I can feel the animosity she has of me still being her 3 weeks and not finding a job yet. All my belongings not in storage are at my exs and when I tried to unblock him asking when I could get them back he said I had to call him and when I refused he said I could write off all my stuff left behind then. I really need to know the kick start to get my life back. I’m quickly falling into a badly depressed state and not having a vehicle or the ability to make money is really triggering it. Not to mention my age, I feel like all the applications I’m putting out there are being laughed at because of that. And I also feel because of the insane prices of everything I’ll never be able to be on my own again and that’s the catalyst of my entire mental health. What can I do to get back to being an independent adult woman who has no vehicle. No savings (I worked for free for my ex, he called it worked for rent and helping with bills. I also gave him all my tax money to help him) No vehicle and no talents. I’m a loser at this point. And a moron who learned to love too late in life to have any sense about it. I just need advice on how to move forward and not feel like a leech with nothing in front of me."}
