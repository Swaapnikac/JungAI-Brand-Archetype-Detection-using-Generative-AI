Try Les Petits Culottes instead. First time father here. I am a witness of how large corporations reduce the quality of the baby diapers to the absolute minimum. They all cost the same, so you don't have a reference for true value. But those gas station toiler paper-thin diapers suck. My wife is from the South of France and she got recommended a local company [https://www.lespetitsculottes.com/fr/](https://www.lespetitsculottes.com/fr/) because that's what frenchies do: shop local and by word of mouth. We live in Italy, and we decided to order some diapers. Holy shit. Same price (or maybe less?) than huggies or pampers, and the quality is incredible. Built like tanks, approximately 3X more absorbent material, super soft all over the place. They never spill. They ship outside of France and you can make a subscription and they send you bulk packs every month. The diapers are made of recycled materials, bio certified, low CO2 footprint, the whole thing. They also sell baby formula, but I haven't tried it yet. It costs a couple of Euros less than what I buy locally. So, I will be trying that one out. They ship outside of France. Try them out!"}

It was messy, we were on and off for almost 5 years. He was always clear he wasn't ready for a relationship and I was always clear I was madly in love with him. Everytime I got tired of the situation and wanted to leave somehow he convinced me to stay, because love is free, we have so much time together, he wasnt ready to commitment. I asked abvice to my sister (now42f) and she gave me some crappy advice like made him compromise, leave sfuff at his place and basically turn him into a boyfriend until it was to late to him to say no. I never managed to do that because I wanted him to love me as much as I loved him, not trap him. During the last night I spend at his place he said he wanted to try something more serious with me, talked about some dates he planned etc. Only to ghost me forever. It was hard. This was the first person I loved and he treated me like crap. Six months passed and my sister came home, we both lived with our parents, saying she wanted to introduce her brand new boyfriend, she had have ton of boyfriends but she said this was the one, it was a dinner only with my parents at our home so I was excluded and expected to just go out or chill in my room. The day came and while they were dinning I ordered a pizza I came downstairs only to find the guy I was with six months prior dinning with my parents and sister. I was shocked but pay for my pizza and went to my room again to cry. After dinner was over I confronted my sister in front of our parents and begged her to not be with him. To be loyal to me, her little sister. There was no way she didn't know who he was, I had showed her pictures of him, his socials media, where he worked and she even know where he lived, they never met because he didn't wanted to met my family and never introduced his. But she knew who he was and she excluded me from that dinner because she _knew_ She said they met by chance after we stopped seeing each other. She knew how hard that \"rupture\" was, she knew how painful it was to not have even a closure, he just stopped replying, not even blocking me just left me there wondering after 5 years. She knew that during those six months I was still hurting. I know how it was my fault, I was too naive and thought that if I stayed long enough he would be ready for the relationship I wanted and would learn to love me. Stupid, I know. She defended herself saying it was a coincidence and chemistry was there, she loved him and she wasn't going to lost the love of her life, this stuff only happens once in lifetime. When I was in my early twenties I would believe that, however now I know that there are 8 billions people in this world, there's no ONE love of your life, you can find the love of your life multiple time if look for it. My parents sided with her and said I should get over it since we never have a real relationship. One and a half year had passed. I've been excluded from multiple family gatherings because he would be around and my family thinks I will bring negative vibes since I'm still bitter about everything. I have no feelings for him but I feel betrayed by my sisters and my parents, he is just pos on my eyes now. My sister is now six months pregnant, due her age she had been extremely pampered by my parents. She still lives at home and is going to move with him maybe two months after the baby is born. Then they're going to marry. In my culture is normal that if a woman gives b"}

And even said I should have posted here first. I'm dividing the post into two halves to make it easier to read. My MIL is insanely entitled. And my wife's enabling of her has made our marriage very hard at times. MIL has come to us for money a lot because she keeps spending herself into a hole since she's a hoarder and a shopaholic. Her house is full of garbage, junk, and unopened stuff she never uses. The house is rodent infested too. She has one semi-clean room in the whole building. And it's the master bedroom. She's mocked it up like a little studio apartment with a futon to sleep on and use as a couch, an entertainment center with TV and streaming, and a makeshift kitchen consisting of the adjoining bathroom, a mini-fridge and a microwave. MIL's also overweight because she eats out a lot. Recently MIL came to us wanting me specifically to buy her a new smartphone as an unprompted gift. And she threw a massive fit when I refused. And I mean a child temper tantrum kind of fit. Why did she want a new phone so suddenly? Hers was two years old, that's literally it. As far as I know, it still worked fine. Even my wife has confirmed this. But MIL was resolute that she deserved a new phone. And before leaving, MIL yelled at us that we're supposed to be pampering her now that she's an old woman. She's 53. My wife also didn't want to buy her mother the phone because she gave her money not long before to make sure her bills were paid. I have quite a collection of vintage skeleton keys. And I mean good ones. Like ones to particular hotels, the large ornate Sargents, brass railroad keys, Reading Hardware, etc. My collection as a whole should easily be worth two to three thousand dollars. Some of those keys are super rare. I kept them in a locked display cabinet. But a few days ago I came home to find my entire collection gone. The cabinet had been forced open. I checked the CCTV for the living room, and saw my MIL force open the cabinet with a small crowbar. She then put all the keys in a couple of boxes she'd brought with her and left with them. I called MIL right away and demanded she return my collection. She nonchalantly told me she sold the entire collection at pawn already, and used the money for her new phone. Then said it was my fault, and she had to do it because I wouldn't give her the money. My wife was seemingly on my side, until I said I was going to call police. She begged me to just drop it. And even suggested I just start a new collection. I refused to let it go, because a lot of those keys are not only expensive, they're irreplaceable. I spent 10 years building that collection. But my wife kept blowing up at me and telling me to just let it go. So I slept in the guest room that night and sought online help the next day when my best friend told me to try Reddit. I'd been a lurker before. But making an account wasn't hard. My MIL has been trouble in the past. But this was the first time I kno"}

Lately she has been getting into boys alot, she is just twelve but she stuffs her bra and she tells boys she loves them and she will fuck them. She uses my stuff, like not to a normal extent she uses every brand new thing i get, i am not allowed to enjoy anything that i buy without her stealing it, i beg her not to touch it but she will go ahead and do whatever she wants. She cusses my mother out whenever she tries to deal with her, she hits my mother and my father does'nt do anything because in front of him she is the sweetest angel. She beats me if i even touch her things, she does'nt let me study, she tears my textbooks if i even touch hers. We took her to a therapist but she pissed the threapist off and refuses to go in for another session. She does not study at all and my dad just pampers her. She is genuinely scared of him but he claims he is too stressed with work to deal with what goes on at home when he isn't here. I can't do this anymore, i wish i was a single child i really do. I hate her so much. She is the brattiest, most self centred disgusting person i know. I cannot belive i am related to her. At the age of tweleve she has vaped and has had two boyfriends and abuses my mother and me emotinally, physically and most of all verbally. I am helpless and I wish my parents never created her. Guys i just wanted calrify a few things: 1. It is not the my parents fault, They have been extremely supportive and loving to both her and me, They have tried their best to raise us to be good people. Yeah, she is definetly pampered at home but she has been hanging out with a group of 13 - 16 yr olds who vape and kiss in public, like full on make out in front of litreal toddlers in the park. some of them smoke weed and cigarettes and most of their parents dont care about their kid or facilitate their childrens actions, its so fucking horrible because just two years ago she was a sweet little girl, we were really close. I never thought she would become the person she is. Today i asked her to move so i could get someting from the shelf behind her and she threw a plate at me and it broke a tile of on floor. My dad is currently out of country, but he is usually home today, if he was here she would'nt have dared to do that. she also kicks my mother when my mother tries to discipline her, and my mother doesnt hit back. SO i dont think it is my parents fault other than the pampering her part. I have tried to stop her but she does not listen. My parents are not aware of the type of people she is with, i have my best tried getting her to leave them. She unlocks the bathroom door takes photos of me when i change and blackmails me using them so i cant even tell my parents. You see why my life has become a living hell with her? 2. I used to beat her up initially, i still remember the first time she raised her hand at me. But it is emotionally draining becuase if i start hitting her back the fight drags out for days on end, If i retalite to her she does'nt stop torturing me she will break my things and tear my clothes to get revenge on me, my dad used to scold her at first but then i just stop retaliting and just take the shit she gives me because i cannot do anything else. My dad is tried of discipling her and me and my mom helpless. I just wish she was never born, my life would have been so much better, i cant do anything anymore and i just keep telling myself that i will leave for college soon. She is litreally a horrible person. I thought i would add this but my sister is also addicted to the phone since she got it three years ago, i was in the tenth grade but she was jut in the fifth grade, we got one each to help with online classes. And she is addicted to it. Just a few hours ago my mom tried to take the phone away, it resulted her in ripping the covers of my mom's bed off to search for it, alon"}

(For example, biodegradable would be nice, but not as important as being fragrance free, so I only gave 0.5 points if noted as biodegradable). - Point totals for each row is in column 10 - Only considered items from stores convenient to me. Ideally would like to be able to have in stock at 2+ stores just in case. - The blowout barrier pockets seemed like a real appeal to me Results - my Top 5 (ish) Picks: 1. Up&amp;Up 2. Huggies Little Snugglers (or the Plus version at Costco) 3. Pampers Pure 4. Bambo Nature 5.

Sex and Sexual Education barely/never gets talked about in India. I'm a 26F who's been sexually active since the last few years. Whatever I've learned, has been from girl-friends, experience, porn (SEX IS 294739% DIFFERENT FROM PORN) and erotica novels There are SO so many things I wish I knew *before*.....or wish I didn't have to learn from experience. Hence I've made this post for all my fellow women, men, and everyone in between. This post is written from a woman's POV but I **strongly advice everyone to read it** regardless of gender and orientation. **Trigger warning** \\- There are mentions of Sexual and mental trauma in this post. But specific points regarding them have NOT been mentioned and I hope to make a specific post about that one day Child and Sexual abuse COMPLETELY change a person's perspective of sex and it has to be dealt with appropriately. If you have been abused in any way, there are chances that it has changed/affected you and you don't even know. **Terminology -** Skinship - Any kind of sexual touching Kissing - Lip to lip kissing 1st base - Boob/butt groping 2nd base - Groin groping 3rd base - Oral Home run - Sex Chapter 1 - **When is the right time to start having sex** When you FEEL like it and when you are 100% sure. The first time I had sex, it was crap. I wasn't sure if I wanted to have sex. I was confused about whether I was ready for the act, whether he was the one, whether I'd regret it later. (I went back to the hostel and cried) And guess what? If you're having these kind of thoughts or doubts YOU ARE PROBABLY **NOT** READY. Being nervous is normal. But being unsure or hesitant usually means you need more time. Sex is as *mental* as physical (especially for women), what I mean by this is to PHYSICALLY enjoy sex, you need to be turned on MENTALLY. If you are worried/not sure/not turned on, its not going to be as fun as its supposed to. The above applies to all kinds of skinship. Do it if you are **ready** and want to do it **with the person**. (both equally important) Age usually doesn't matter BUT I strongly advice you to be **older than 18** (no less than 16 please) because being sexually active *does* open up the chances of trauma and I would never wish my 16/17 year old self to experience the same things I did at 21+ (actually I wouldn't want ANYONE and ANY AGE to get trauma but as an older person I was better equipped to handle something like that) You are **never too late** to do any kind of skinship. But **you can be EARLY**. **Do not be pressured into anything! Not even holding hands!** Bollywood shows its okay to forcibly hold her hand and \"Haseena maan jayegi\", that girls are just \"shy\" so if you \"push enough\" itll be fine. NO! If you aren't ready, if skinship makes you unhappy then don't do it. Be a \"prude\". Be \"backward\". Be \"boring\". But you'll be happy and **that is worth hell more**. (I learnt this the hard way and I wish you don't have to) If you are in a relationship and your significant other is pushing you, tell them why you aren't ready. Tell them what you feel inside. Be honest. If they do actually like/love you, they'll wait. If they don't wait/shame/pressure/force you **BREAK UP**. That's a big red flag. They care about more their *physical want* instead of your *mental health*. After my first time I went back to my hostel and cried. I was not ready for it. Don't want you to do the same mistake I did. Chapter 2 - **CONSENT** Now that you have decided that you are ready for skinship and ready with a particular person, how do you go about it? **TALK!** Communication is the best thing you can do in this situation. Its going to be awkward, its going to be embarrassing, you'll be shy, but if you communicate throughout it, you'll get over the above hurdles and it'll actually be fun! **If you are initiating**, best thing you can do is ***ask*** \"Hey can I hold your hand?/I'm going to hold your hand..\" \"I'm going to kiss you"}

Here are my top 10 favorites. Hey everyone, I’ve once again tried every omakase in Chicago and wanted to update my previous ranking, which I published here a while ago [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagofood/comments/1b1r3m8/i_tried_nearly_all_of_the_omakases_in_chicago/). In retrospect, I should have waited longer to publish until I had actually eaten at every omakase. Well, I have now, and I’ve also revisited all the others I had previously tried since posting my last list. Just for transparency, the full list of omakases I ate at on top of the ones in the top 10 are Yokocho, Casa Madai, Raisu, Juno, Sushi Suite 202, Sushi By Bou, Kai Zan, Nomonomo Sushi, and Tamu. A couple caveats, as always, before I start giving my thoughts on the individual restaurants. When I am evaluating these restaurants, I am not putting nearly as much stock into the service/experience as many people do when reviewing food. The lion's share of what I care about lies in how good I think the food is. If you're someone that values these things almost as much or as much as the food itself, my ranking might not be very useful to you. Places that had \"omakases\" that were not nigiri-focused edomae style sushiya spots were not considered such as Komo, Kumiko, Q Sushi, Roka Akor, M Room, and NoMI Kitchen. Since my last list, Kyoku Sushi and Sushi | Bar have closed permanently so they would also no longer be in consideration for this list. Since I got this question several times last time, 312 Fish Market is still my favorite spot for a la carte sushi. I don't claim to be a sushi expert, I am just a guy that loves sushi and spends money very irresponsibly on it. Most omakases are generally very enjoyable experiences. If you went to a spot that didn't make my top 10 and loved it, that's awesome. It might not be bad just because it isn't in my top 10, this is a pretty competitive field. Please try restaurants for yourself and form your own opinions, supporting restaurants is the best thing you can do to keep them around. **Number 10. Sushi By Scratch, River West ($185)** Sushi By Scratch was one I hadn't tried yet when I published my last list and many people let me know that it was a huge omission from that list. I ate there twice since then and the experiences were certainly fun. Each time I went, they had a totally different set of chefs preparing the food. I thought they executed really well in atmosphere, service, and showmanship. Sushi by Scratch is probably one of the best versions of a bromakase we have to offer in Chicago. \"Bromakase\" is a term, not a Japanese word, used to describe a type of high-end, often theatrical, sushi dining experience that has become popular, particularly among younger, affluent men. This isn't a bad thing, it makes sense that many people would love this experience. If you are more traditionalist about sushi like I am, this might not be the right fit for you. However, I think Sushi By Scratch is a great option if you are someone that wants to celebrate an occasion with some sushi without having much experience with sushi in general looking to expand your horizons and try some higher end ingredients. If you are looking for something authentically Japanese, I would look elsewhere. Sushi By Scratch isn't trying to be that, they are doing their own thing. **Number 9. Mako, West Loop ($215)** Mako is now Chicago's only Michelin-starred sushiya, so it might be puzzling to see it not even be a top-8 sushiya in Chicago. For the price, it is hard to recommend Mako over any of the places that I have ranked above it. The menu at Mako is certainly diverse and interesting, although it is hard to imagine that you could make nigiri bites any smaller than Mako is. The last time I went to Mako, my chef was only on his third day after working as a sushi chef at BK Park's sister restaurant, Juno. I didn’t see BK Park during either visit, so I’m not sure if he still works behind the counter. The execution at "}

Strap in friends, this is a LOOOOOOONG one. There’s a ton of backstory that I feel like I need to say to help get you up to speed, and I’m sorry for it, but I feel like you need to hear it so you won’t be lost. I have been with my wife for 10 years, 4 of it married. We started dating in College, I liked her enough to hitch my wagon long term and I love her very much. Unfortunately, her mother is a horrible person so I’ve had to deal with her the past decade as well. For 10 years, I have watched my MIL constantly break down my wife, gaslight her, berate her, and treat her like a child even though she’s pushing 30. About a year ago, my wife finally stood up to her and [I detailed it on the raised by narcissist subreddit.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/78p6fn/im_so_incredibly_proud_of_my_wife_for_finally/) I was incredibly proud of her and I still am because it took a lot for her to finally stand up for herself. It’s been a relatively quiet year from MIL’s end, but that’s mainly because we’ve kept her and her husband at arm’s length. More recently though, more contact has been had for an assortment of reasons. It’s been a rough summer for our little family unit. There’s been a lot of good, but there’s been a lot of stress. I started a new job with much more responsibility than my old one, my wife started a new position as a kindergarten teacher at a brand-new school and was named team lead, we found out in April that we are pregnant with our second child (we find out the gender on the 14th!), which unfortunately lead to an entire first trimester of illness for my wife. We also bought a new house, had to move, our daughter is now a full-blown toddler with all the ups and downs that that entails, and to top it all off, my Wife’s grandmother (MIL’s Mother) passed away within the past month. While my wife isn’t a fan of her mother, she was very close to her grandmother. This death in the family has lead to more interaction with her mother than we originally planned, but the interaction was inevitable. On top of all of this going on, my SIL, the golden child, became engaged, moved to our current town that is about 3 hours away from MIL, and, SURPRISE! She’s pregnant now too! Since she’s the golden child, she’s being pampered and promised things my wife never received when we announced our first pregnancy. Also, the in-laws don’t even acknowledge that my wife is pregnant again with baby #2. This honestly doesn’t bother us because that means we don’t have to see them that often. Unfortunately though, since SIL now lives near us, that means MIL wants to try and slide her way back into our lives. We have been putting off having her parents visit for months, and now that SIL has announced her pregnancy, MIL convinced the SIL to let her come down and buy her things like maternity clothes toys, and other things she never did for my wife. Unfortunately for my MIL, my future BIL hates both her and my FIL, and refuses to let them stay at his house (this is an entire sub-drama in and of itself) so they tried to slllllllllide their way into our guest bedroom by trying to bribe us with buying a grill as a housewarming gift. As they have been on their best behavior recently, we were willing to let it happen as long as MIL behaved. Since I’m posting on here, I’m sure you can guess that things went south. As it happens, my wife and my SIL are in a bit of a tiff at the moment. My wife needed help moving into her new classroom and her sister promised to help. The day that they agreed on arrives and my SIL is nowhere to be found. My wife called her up to make sure she was ok, and she was, pregnancy brain kicked it and she just completely forgot. My wife was understandably annoyed but would have gotten over it if SIL would have just apologized. Instead, she got an apology that was reminiscent of something their mother would say. Her “apology” boiled down to “I didn’t mean to. I’m sorry, but I "}

OH the stories I can (and will) tell. For now though, I will stick to the time I worked for a small Catholic newspaper. Now, just a disclaimer, I, myself, am NOT Catholic. But I luckily (well, at first), that did not stop me from being hired. This was both a blessing, in that it paid the bills and I got to do what I loved as the sole Graphic Designer, and a curse, in that I worked with some over the top people, including one that kept trying to \"convert\" me, a woman who was the epitome of being a \"Karen\" years before being a \"Karen\" was even a thing, and a man who was a deacon, who literally spearheaded a campaign with a subordinate of his to gaslight me, and then went on to harass another female worker as well, along with stealing commissions from yet another subordinate. This story involves the \"Karen,\" whom we will call Rachel (not her real name). Rachel had been hired as a secretary and additional receptionist (we were a small office of up to 10-12 people max at any given time). When she came on, she was married and had a child. Like me, she was initially not Catholic, but later became Catholic. I mention this, because it is important in the grand scheme of things. See, the only reason she became Catholic (and she openly admitted this to me and others in the office that WERE all Catholic and had been for most of their lives, if not all), is because she found out that by her and her son being Catholic, she could get the church to foot the bill for her sending her son to a Catholic private school, instead of a public one. She did this because she wanted a private education for her son, but didn't want to pay for it. So she went through RCIA and had him go through RCIC and the whole 9 yards, then told their church that they \"couldn't afford\" to send him to Catholic school and got the church to pay for it instead (Catholic churches will help parishioners that want to, but can't afford to send their kids to Catholic schools, do so by paying for the school themselves, out of the money that has been donated by other parishioners). So she got what she wanted. This frustrated a fellow co-worker when she found out, because she had been their sponsor and thought Rachel had been sincere in her wish to be Catholic. During this time, Rachel made it all but abundantly clear that she only plays \"Catholic\" when she needs to, so as to get what she wants or needs, like that money for the school, but has no intention of actually living the life of a Catholic. Now, I had no intention of living life as a Catholic either, so I can understand that part. But then again, I never had any intention of becoming a Catholic, and they all knew this. Whenever Rachel's son needed to buy books, or get money for extra curricular activities, or lunch money or field trips, etc., Rachel would immediately go to her church's parish office, looking her poorest and most \"vulnerable\" and ask them to cover the amount. And they always did. Again, pissing off out fellow co-worker who was a member of the same parish and had sponsored them. We all knew that Rachel's husband made a decent living, but apparently he either didn't know what she was really doing, or didn't care. Due to what would happen a few years later, I am guessing that he didn't know and thought that his money was paying for the school and all the amenities. Because while their son (who was a nice kid actually. and so was the husband the few times I meant t"}

Sex and Sexual Education barely/never gets talked about in India. I'm a 26F who's been sexually active since the last few years. Whatever I've learned, has been from girl-friends, experience, porn (SEX IS 294739% DIFFERENT FROM PORN) and erotica novels There are SO so many things I wish I knew *before*.....or wish I didn't have to learn from experience. Hence I've made this post for all my fellow women, men, and everyone in between. This post is written from a woman's POV but I **strongly advice everyone to read it** regardless of gender and orientation. **Trigger warning** \\- There are mentions of Sexual and mental trauma in this post. But specific points regarding them have NOT been mentioned and I hope to make a specific post about that one day Child and Sexual abuse COMPLETELY change a person's perspective of sex and it has to be dealt with appropriately. If you have been abused in any way, there are chances that it has changed/affected you and you don't even know. **Terminology -** Skinship - Any kind of sexual touching Kissing - Lip to lip kissing 1st base - Boob/butt groping 2nd base - Groin groping 3rd base - Oral Home run - Sex &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Chapter 1 - **When is the right time to start having sex** When you FEEL like it and when you are 100% sure. The first time I had sex, it was crap. I wasn't sure if I wanted to have sex. I was confused about whether I was ready for the act, whether he was the one, whether I'd regret it later. (I went back to the hostel and cried) And guess what? If you're having these kind of thoughts or doubts YOU ARE PROBABLY **NOT** READY. Being nervous is normal. But being unsure or hesitant usually means you need more time. Sex is as *mental* as physical (especially for women), what I mean by this is to PHYSICALLY enjoy sex, you need to be turned on MENTALLY. If you are worried/not sure/not turned on, its not going to be as fun as its supposed to. The above applies to all kinds of skinship. Do it if you are **ready** and want to do it **with the person**. (both equally important) Age usually doesn't matter BUT I strongly advice you to be **older than 18** (no less than 16 please) because being sexually active *does* open up the chances of trauma and I would never wish my 16/17 year old self to experience the same things I did at 21+ (actually I wouldn't want ANYONE and ANY AGE to get trauma but as an older person I was better equipped to handle something like that) &amp;#x200B; You are **never too late** to do any kind of skinship. But **you can be EARLY**. **Do not be pressured into anything! Not even holding hands!** Bollywood shows its okay to forcibly hold her hand and \"Haseena maan jayegi\", that girls are just \"shy\" so if you \"push enough\" itll be fine. NO! If you aren't ready, if skinship makes you unhappy then don't do it. Be a \"prude\". Be \"backward\". Be \"boring\". But you'll be happy and **that is worth hell more**. (I learnt this the hard way and I wish you don't have to) If you are in a relationship and your significant other is pushing you, tell them why you aren't ready. Tell them what you feel inside. Be honest. If they do actually like/love you, they'll wait. If they don't wait/shame/pressure/force you **BREAK UP**. That's a big red flag. They care about more their *physical want* instead of your *mental health*. After my first time I went back to my hostel and cried. I was not ready for it. Don't want you to do the same mistake I did. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Chapter 2 - **CONSENT** Now that you have decided that you are ready for skinship and ready with a particular person, how do you go about it? **TALK!** Communication is the best thing you can do in this situation. Its going to be awkward, its going to be embarrassing, you'll be shy, but if you communicate throughout it, you'll get over the above hurdles and it'll actually be fun! **If you are initiating**, best thing you can do is ***ask*"}

It was messy, we were on and off for almost 5 years. He was always clear he wasn't ready for a relationship and I was always clear I was madly in love with him. Everytime I got tired of the situation and wanted to leave somehow he convinced me to stay, because love is free, we have so much time together, he wasnt ready to commitment. I asked abvice to my sister (now42f) and she gave me some crappy advice like made him compromise, leave sfuff at his place and basically turn him into a boyfriend until it was to late to him to say no. I never managed to do that because I wanted him to love me as much as I loved him, not trap him. During the last night I spend at his place he said he wanted to try something more serious with me, talked about some dates he planned etc. Only to ghost me forever. It was hard. This was the first person I loved and he treated me like crap. Six months passed and my sister came home, we both lived with our parents, saying she wanted to introduce her brand new boyfriend, she had have ton of boyfriends but she said this was the one, it was a dinner only with my parents at our home so I was excluded and expected to just go out or chill in my room. The day came and while they were dinning I ordered a pizza I came downstairs only to find the guy I was with six months prior dinning with my parents and sister. I was shocked but pay for my pizza and went to my room again to cry. After dinner was over I confronted my sister in front of our parents and begged her to not be with him. To be loyal to me, her little sister. There was no way she didn't know who he was, I had showed her pictures of him, his socials media, where he worked and she even know where he lived, they never met because he didn't wanted to met my family and never introduced his. But she knew who he was and she excluded me from that dinner because she _knew_ She said they met by chance after we stopped seeing each other. She knew how hard that \"rupture\" was, she knew how painful it was to not have even a closure, he just stopped replying, not even blocking me just left me there wondering after 5 years. She knew that during those six months I was still hurting. I know how it was my fault, I was too naive and thought that if I stayed long enough he would be ready for the relationship I wanted and would learn to love me. Stupid, I know. She defended herself saying it was a coincidence and chemistry was there, she loved him and she wasn't going to lost the love of her life, this stuff only happens once in lifetime. When I was in my early twenties I would believe that, however now I know that there are 8 billions people in this world, there's no ONE love of your life, you can find the love of your life multiple time if look for it. My parents sided with her and said I should get over it since we never have a real relationship. One and a half year had passed. I've been excluded from multiple family gatherings because he would be around and my family thinks I will bring negative vibes since I'm still bitter about everything. I have no feelings for him but I feel betrayed by my sisters and my parents, he is just pos on my eyes now. My sister is now six months pregnant, due her age she had been extremely pampered by my parents. She still lives at home and is going to move with him maybe two months after the baby is born. Then they're going to marry. In my culture is normal that if a woman gives birth moves back (or stay) with her mom so the mom will help with the baby for the first months. A week ago my sister's friends made a surprise baby shower I happened to be at home I tried to talk to them, I don't know why, maybe because my sister and I were to close before and I'm sad we're not longer friends. But her friends acted like I wasn't there and only replied to me with 'hmm' 'yes' 'n"}

(that nobody asked for) is finally here! Confession time - I'm in my late 30's and it's wild to me that I could have been baking a child this whole time but instead I chose half price hair care products. No, the ex that inspired my hair glow up is not back - thank you for your concern. And yes, I still use Pantene sometimes. It's been nine long months since I set out to test and trial the precious few viral TikTok products recommended by Abbey Yung that are actually available here in Australia. I didn't know what I expected out of this process. Nicer hair maybe? Not like hair commercial nice, but actually wearing it down for a change after you wash it nice. For the uninitiated, I have an oily scalp and fine hair that I have coloured every six weeks from mousey brown to copper red. What I *can* say with pride is that my very fussy, snobby, middle-aged European hairdresser is praising the health, condition and shine of my hair for the first time. I have been a regular client of his for over five years, and he has never been this effusive about the condition and health of my hair. Now - have I been completely honest with him about my little experiments? No, and I never will. He has some very strong ideas about home hair care and I have decided to maintain my fiction of 'just using a hair mask every time I wash it now' for the sake of our hairdresser-client relationship. I don't feel great about lying to my Husband in Hair, but a woman must do what is necessary in these troubled times. Also as a disclaimer - I spent all of my own foolish money on this stuff. Brands don't know I exist and this post is definitely NOT sponsored. Where to start? What probably surprised me the most is that many of the products that made a significant difference in my hair were the most affordable. Yep. A [$5 microfibre hair towel ](https://www.kmart.com.au/product/oxx-bodycare-hair-drying-turban-lilac-43413195/)from Kmart has been one of my biggest heroes. I use this to take my hair from drippy to just damp, which is a must when using K18 (more on that later). I also found I've had less breakage since using this towel to partially dry my hair before applying any leave-in product. I'm sure you can probably get cheaper \\*and\\* more expensive options, but this one has been wonderful for me. I toss it in the wash and then the dryer with the rest of my bathroom towels and it's still going strong after months of regular use. The next thing I observed over time was the one product I reach for when I want great results but I'm either feeling lazy or in a rush. The award for that goes to the humble lamellar rinse. The OG version of this product is [L'Oreal Wonder Water](https://www.priceline.com.au/product/189973/l-oreal-paris-elvive-colour-protect-wonder-water-200ml). L'Oreal also make a [dry hair version ](https://www.priceline.com.au/product/189972/l-oreal-paris-elvive-hyaluron-plump-wonder-water-200ml)with hyaluronic acid. [Garnier make a version too](https://www.chemistwarehouse.com.au/buy/136673/garnier-fructis-hair-drink-pineapple-200ml). I've tried all three and they give the same results, but Garnier has a sweet fruity fragrance that some may not like. To get the best results from a lamellar rinse, I double shampoo (as always) turn off the water in the shower and squeeze out the excess water from my hair. I then scrunch my hair in the Kmart microfibre hair towel mentioned earlier until my hair is just damp. I gather a section of hair in my hand and apply it from my upper mid lengths to my ends and massage it in for 8 - 10 seconds before moving on to the next section. One important thing to note is that this is literally a water in terms of texture, so make sure when holding your section of hair that your hand is directly under the section you are working on. Otherwise you will just end up squirting half of it into the abyss of your shower. Also - be careful where you pu"}

Some Kids just Deserve to Die The costume I was forced to wear as mascot for Derby's Fun Land was not built for warm weather or user comfort. I was sweating profusely as I stood outside in the noonday sun, a silent prisoner in my oversized getup as I put on a fake happy voice, dancing and capering with visitors. All the while, dying inside. This wasn't what I'd pictured when I'd decided to become a character actor. The costume had the oversized head of a cartoon dog whose gaping mouth I peered out from within. The character wore a blue sailor outfit, a blatant rip-off of a popular duck character created by another brand - a fact which I was heckled for constantly. \"Hey, Derby! Duck!\" a little kid yelled, tossing his hot dog at me and staining my costume yellow with mustard across the front. It was the third time that morning I'd been assaulted by a child, which was my cue to take a smoke break. I began stomping away when someone called after me angrily. \"Hey, asshole! My kid wanted a show, where do you think you're going?\" I turned around and saw a red-faced man with a large camera strapped around his neck, wearing a fanny pack and an Ed Hardy shirt. The devil-child’s father, I presumed. \"Whoops,\" I said, gritting my teeth and looking down at the obnoxious twerp who'd just branded me with mustard. \"How do you Derby-do, little fella? Are you havin' a great day at Derby's Fun Land?\" The kid leered up at me, grinning a gap-toothed bully's smile. \"You wrecked my Derby Dog! Now I want a new one! No! I want an ice cream cone!\" The little snot knew damn well what he'd done. His dad hadn't seen it, but the two of us knew that he'd purposefully ruined my costume with his hot dog, and was now blaming me for it. It was too much for me to handle. Maybe it was the heat. Maybe it was the fact that I hadn't eaten breakfast yet. Or maybe it was just the infuriating grin of that punk kid staring up at me, knowing he could get away with murder. \"I think you're remembering that wrong, little friend. You threw your hotdog at Derby.\" \"Hey! My kid wouldn't do that! Don't blame him for your clumsy ass!\" The little boy took a cue from his father and started crying crocodile tears. \"Derby's a big fat liar! He wrecked my hotdog!\" A moment later the guy was attacking me, shoving me until eventually my manager had to come over - his face a frustrating mask of calm. \"What seems to be the problem here?\" \"This punk ruined my kid's lunch, and now he's trying to blame him for it! I should sue you guys!\" Sure, sue me for a hotdog, I thought in my head. Thankfully it had gone too far by this point and I knew better than to say it out loud. \"I'm terribly sorry, sir. Please, follow me this way. Let me take you to our VIP lounge and we'll get you and your son some complimentary refreshments. Looks like you need a refill there, too!\" He pointed at the dad's red plastic cup of beer, nearly empty. The guy finished it off in one long swig and tossed the cup at a nearby trash can, missing completely. \"Damn straight. C’mon Skylar, we’re VIPs,\" he slurred, before burping loudly. I'd seen this before. Some people tried to make a stink about everything, just to get free stuff. But this douchebag was taking it to another level. Even the kid seemed to be in on it. And they were gonna reward this behaviour? Hell no. I'd never even heard of the Derby's Fun Land visitor VIP lounge. But it sounded bad-ass. And this guy didn’t deserve whatever pampering he was about to get. I was picturing champagne and caviar, cigars and high-quality porno magazines. My boss looked over his shoulder at me with a glare that said he'd talk to me later, then escorted the two away into a secret door hidden behind a fake tree prop. I followed them, thinking I would give my boss a piece of my mind. If he fired me, so be it. I’d taken enough abuse. The dark tunnel behind the fake tree was long and lined with ancient brick. It appeared to be as old as the park itself. Far up ahe"}

Not sure if Skincare***Addiction*** will receive this post well, but it needs to be said. **Sheet masks are extremely wasteful.** Everything about a sheet mask is made for one use. The sheet itself is obviously meant to be thrown away after one use. What’s more concerning is that the packaging that it comes in is not recyclable. Though it might feel and tear like paper, most sheet mask packaging is lined on the inside with a thin plastic film. This is to keep the serum from seeping out of the paper layer. You can neither throw it in with paper products not plastics. It’s waste that goes to the landfill. **Sheet masks are not very hygienic.** It might surprise you to know that sheet masks are probably the only skincare product that are touched by human hands. Most sheet masks on the market are folded by [hand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjUvaOfQjoc) or by a [semi-automatic machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SFuPoGTq-A). Both of these methods require human hands to touch *every single sheet* . Moreover, when folding by hand, there is a sheet of plastic that helps guide the folds which doesn’t appear to be disinfected between use. **Sheet mask manufacturing is accused of involving poor labour protections.** Most companies give the sheet mask manufacturing to subcontractors, so none are made in-house. There have been multiple accusations of companies using home labour i.e., making these masks in private homes of the labour, which is illegal in Korea. Luxury and affordable brands alike have been accused of these practices many times in the past few years. [2008](http://enews.imbc.com/News/RetrieveNewsInfo/29995) [2014](https://www.cosinkorea.com/news/article.html?no=8333) [2016](https://weekly.donga.com/BestClick/3/all/11/536977/1) **Sheet masks don’t need to be wasteful.** There are many DIYs that show you how to make your own. I used [this](https://blog.mountainroseherbs.com/hubfs/FacialMask\\_Template%20(1).jpg) template to cut from a muslin cloth (you can use an old cotton t-shirt too!). I soak it in mixture of cold water and a toner of choice, currently it’s the Laneige Cream Skin. After each use, I throw it in the washing machine and air dry it. Best thing about using muslin is that it gets softer the more you wash it! I won’t deny that sheet masks are luxurious and pampering, especially when you need a pick-me-up. And that’s what they are, an occasional treat to self-indulge, not an essential part of a routine. Edit: formatting Update: Thank you so much for the awards, completely didn't see that coming! There's been conversation about including makeup wipes in this post. It didn't occur to me because I don't see them much, if at all, on ScA, unlike sheet masks. I didn't want to be singing to the choir about something that's not really supported here anyway. It is very important to discuss nonetheless. Consumption habits and waste in general need to be discussed more here. Thank you for the positive response. This has been about making people reconsider and starting out with small steps. :)"}

My son is in size four so i offered the diapers in his bag but she said she only uses pampers brand."}

Link please? Kaelen was supposed to be my destiny. The future Alpha of our pack, my childhood love, and my fated mate. But one night, I smelled another woman on him--a sickly sweet Omega scent I knew all too well. I followed him and found them under the great oak, locked in a lover's k**s. His betrayal was a slow and deliberate poison. When his precious Omega, Lyra, staged a fall, he cradled her like she was made of glass. But when he sabotaged my saddle during a dangerous jump, causing my horse to throw me and break my leg, he called it a \"warning\" not to touch her. His care for me afterward was just damage control to avoid my father's suspicion. At a public auction, he used my family's money to buy her a priceless diamond, leaving me humiliated and unable to pay. I finally understood what I'd overheard on the pack's mind-link days before. To him and his brothers-in-arms, I was just a \"pampered princess,\" a prize to be won for power. Lyra was the one they truly de**red. He thought he could break me, force me to accept being second best. He was wrong. On the night of my 20th birthday, the night I was supposed to be bonded to him, I stood before two packs and made a different choice. I rejected him and announced my union with a rival Alpha, a man who sees me as a queen, not a consolation prize. Chapter 1 No.1 Aria POV: The night air of the Silver Moon territory was crisp and clean, carrying the scent of pine and damp earth. It was my territory, my home, and one day, it would be my responsibility as Luna. But tonight, all I cared about was the man walking beside me. Kaelen. His presence was a physical force, a magnetic pull that had governed my world since we were children. He was the future Alpha, chosen by my father for his unmatched strength and strategic mind. And, as everyone in the pack whispered, he was my destiny. My heart did a familiar flip as his arm brushed against mine. I breathed in, expecting his signature scent, the one that always calmed my inner wolf--the bracing aroma of a snowstorm breaking over a cedar forest. It was the scent I dreamed of, the scent of my supposed mate. But tonight, something was wrong. Underneath the familiar cedar and winter air, another scent clung to him. It was sickly sweet, like cheap candy and cloying jasmine. An Omega's scent. A scent I knew all too well. Lyra. My stomach twisted into a cold knot. Lyra, the fragile Omega he and the other warriors had been brought in with, the one he insisted on treating like a sister. \"You were with Lyra,\" I stated, my voice flat, betraying none of the turmoil inside me. Kaelen's stride didn't falter. \"She was feeling unwell. I took her some herbs.\" His voice was smooth, but the lie was as loud as a scream to my senses. The scent wasn't from a casual visit; it was deeply ingrained in the fibers of his leather jacket, a mark of prolonged, close contact. We continued our patrol in silence, the easy camaraderie we usually shared now replaced by a thick, suffocating tension. When we reached the edge of the ancient woods that bordered the main estate, he stopped. \"I'll finish the southern perimeter. You head back.\" I just nodded, unable to look at him. But I didn't head back. A dark premonition coiled in my gut. I circled around, using the cover of the dense woods to shadow his path. My wolf senses, already heightened by suspicion, made me silent, a ghost in the trees. And then I saw them. Under the gnarled branches of the great oak, where pack mates often pledged their love, Kaelen stood with Lyra. Her arms were wrapped around his neck, her body pressed against his. The moonlight illuminated the scene with brutal clarity. He leaned down, and their lips met in a fierce, po**essive k**s that sent a wave of nausea through me. It wasn't a brotherly k**s. It was the k**s of lovers. My world, once a bright and hopeful place centered around him, shattered into a million icy fragments. I didn't make a sound. I"}

Normally two species did not share a room, but this room had a null-g hospital bed for a small green mantid tucked up next to a larger bed for a Hakanian. The Hakanian twisted and writhed, despite the anesthetic beam, moaning out loud and muttering fragments of speech. The green mantid would jerk, his three legs scrabbling, the regen cast where the missing leg had been clicking now and then, and data would stream down the computer screens. On the other side of the viewing window, in the observation room, stood a gold mantid, a russet mantid, and a Rigellian female, one a psychic surgeon, one a medical surgeon, the other a Defense Services Intelligence Agency officer. Against the wall stood two women, short, thick bodied, black hair, in suits and apparently unarmed, their gunmetal gray eyes staring straight ahead. Confederate Intelligence Agents. The gold mantid opened a window in the smartglass and scrolled through the data. \"The dream blocker medication is working somewhat, but those aren't dreams, they're implanted memories,\" the gold mantid, one *Finds Common Ground*, said.

He says these three letters are special, this building is special. For every talent who walked out of that video board, for every staff member and kid who went to Full Sail, all of them were special. He says what's really special about this is all of them, everyone in this building and those watching at home on the CW, they are why NXT is here and stronger than ever. They took something that started as a whisper and turned it into an undeniable roar. Their passion along with the talent and everyone else turned it into that roar, shattered conventions, allowed NXT to Takeover.

He thanks Triple H for taking time out of his busy schedule but he is here to let him know that he and his NXT roster are ready to steer this ship into the future. Triple H tells Shawn that his NXT crew is setting the world on fire, but what if he said he wanted to come back? Shawn says he didn't want this to get uncomfortable but then they'd have a really, really big problem. William Regal is here! He says gentlemen please there's only one way to settle this, War Games!

I’m talking newbie stuff that I probably could have figured out on my own- and yet somehow totally didn’t in my 27 years of professionally owning a face. I wanted to share a list of the best ones that come to mind, and invite anyone else to share their most substantial, yet totally newbie-level things they’ve learned here too. So without further ado, here are the single most significant “super-beginner” things I’ve learned on this sub that have made the biggest impact on my skincare. —— 1. BLOTTING This is so “stupid-obvious” and yet I literally never thought about doing it. I have oily skin, and throughout the day, I would notice the valley between my nose and cheeks getting shiny, but I’d just sigh and do nothing about it. “Ah well.” I’d say. Girl. Use a paper towel! Gently tap the area! BOOM! Excess oil soaked up. Shine gone. Makeup and skincare completely safe. And your skin isn’t rubbed dry or deprived of natural moisture. Genius. Yet so, SO, basic. Brown paper towels in public bathrooms are honestly my favorite for this too, which couldn’t get easier. Nothing to buy or pack. Since doing this 1-2 times a day when I notice it, I no longer get pimples in the middle of my cheeks. Honestly I feel like a total idiot for never considering this technique, but here I am! So yeah, blotting. —— 2. CHANGE YOUR PILLOWCASE Another obvious thing that I really should have known, (and to be fair, I did, I’m just lazy and gross I guess) is to change your dang pillowcases! I’ve started to do this once a week, but I’ve seen others on here do it even daily. Think about all the nasty stuff from your hair, mouth, scalp, nose, sweat, bacteria, etc. All being smooshed against your skin for hours each night. Imagine spending your whole routines all day to pamper your skin, and then rubbing your face directly in a dirty gym shirt for eight hours. Plus you’re giving off heat and moisture, so just picture all the bacteria living it up in the sauna that is your old pillowcase fibers. I’m super grossed out to admit that I legitimately wouldn’t change my pillowcases for months sometimes. (Sorry, mom.) But now I know better, and I am thankful this sub helped me realize. —— 3. OILY SKIN NEEDS SKINCARE TOO I legitimately used to be absolutely terrified of leaving anything on my face that wasn’t immediately cleansed off. I thought EVERYTHING would cause acne, because in my head, I’d think: “Oh I have oily skin. I would not dream of adding even MORE stuff on top. I’d get so many pimples.” I hated the idea of moisturizer- it was ass backwards to me. I thought I needed less hydration, not more. I also thought I would explode into full blown pizza face if I put sunscreen on. Obviously now I know these are all totally not true. Oily skin needs moisture, and in fact, moisturizers can help skin become less oily over time as your skin feels less need to over-produce. And everyone needs sunscreen. But the biggest takeaway is just: skincare products aren’t grease!!!! Don’t be phobic just because you have this incorrect worry that your skin must be bone dry or else be in danger of breaking out. Obviously some products could give you reactions like this. But skincare in general can be trusted. It’s meant to make your skin look better, and become healthier. —— 4. SUNSCREEN IS SHINY You’re probably always going to need powder or a BB cream. Maybe people with dry skin can get away with walking out the door immediately after applying sunscreen, but it’s honestly not a big deal to be shiny (and in fact probably means good things like you’re wearing enough!). Don’t waste hundreds on a dozen different sunscreens to find a holy grail that has it “all”, I.e. no fragrance, no white cast, dries well, non-greasy, tinted perfect shade, moisturizing, affordable, available"}

(4.0.13 patch notes at the bottom) We expect the 4.0.14 release will be next week (probably on Tuesday), and is expected to include some fixes to a few infinite loops and some select balance changes (like splitting up Enforcers and Telepaths again). It will be a short work week here in Sweden, so it’s likely to be the only update of the week. As I mentioned last week, with multiplayer stability largely handled, AI is one of our next focuses. Today I want to talk about AI benchmarks, and have a discussion with you about how we should measure “success”. # What Makes a Good AI? The AI in Stellaris has always been designed as very reactive, and AI personality has a massive impact on their behavior. Our goal is for our AI empires to feel like actors in the galactic play - acting in a manner consistent with their Origins, Authorities, Civics, and Ethics rather than always picking the “meta” play. They do still need to put up a bit of a challenge though, especially at higher difficulties. The first economic goal we make for our AI is “please don’t collapse in an economic death spiral”, and it’s actually far better at that in 4.0 than it was in 3.x. The current AI does NOT meet the second “provide an adequate challenge” goal though. One of the fundamental tools we have for our AIs are resource targets in their economic plans. They’ll strive to reach those targets, and many of these are set as “scaling” - if they meet the target, they’ll raise the target the next month. This attempts to ensure that they’ll keep thirsting for ever larger research and alloy numbers (or food if they use bioships!) as is appropriate. This is one of the tools we also use to make them exhibit their ethics - Materialists scale their Research targets faster than other empires, so they’ll inherently be more likely to build more Research specializations, while Spiritualists are more likely to have a lot of Unity specializations. Ironically, improving AI tends to consume any benefits we carved out through performance improvements. The stronger the AI, the more stuff they have - fleets, colonies, and so on. # Benchmarking One way to decide whether or not the AI is performing up to expectations is through benchmarking - what kind of fleet power, alloy generation, and research generation should they have by 2230, 2250, 2300, and so on? Around what year should they hit 10k fleet power? Then there come questions around whether the benchmarks should differ based on personality type. Should it be different if they’re Democratic Crusaders vs. Peaceful Traders? Or does differentiating them there make the friendlier empires too weak? I’ve got my own set of benchmarks that come from running 3.14 and from the multiplayer community, and in general, I’m okay with Grand Admiral being significantly harder than it was in 3.14. but I’m interested to hear what you all strive for. How much research and alloy production do you try to have 10 years, 30 years, 100 years, and when the end-game crisis comes calling? (Include your preferred difficulty settings and galaxy sizes as well if you could, as well as if you change any other important settings like tech costs.) # What’s Next? We’re going to continue with 4.0 post release support. Since the next two weeks are both short weeks in Sweden, our next Stellaris Dev Diary will be June 12th. (You’ll be hearing from me in patch notes in the meantime though. -Eladrin) **Stellaris 4.0.13 Patch** # Improvements * Behemoth Fury is now available to Wilderness Empires. * Improved tooltips for the following civics: * Functional Architecture/Constructobot * Environmentalist * Astro-mining Drones * Maintenance Protocols * Ascensionists * Augmentation Bazaars * Brand Loyalty * Death Cults * Dimensional Worship # Balance * Mutagenic Habitability now "}

They need to update The Brand.” Harold notes before he suddenly rushes forward. Hafid catches his fist against the flat of his sword, but is sent skidding back either way. “We were all so concerned with keeping water off us to stop drowning we didn’t think about techniques like yours.” “That was merely my getting into the appropriate mindset.” Hafid states. “It is not meant to end fights, although for many it does.” “I’m sure, because a technique that makes the area dryer than hard vacuum is a simple mindset. I’ve fought Apuk battle princesses with their warfire and it’s not this dry. You’re deliberately evaporating water and disguising it with heat.” “The heat is usually more than enough. Few have the will to even stand beneath the glare of the sun.” “... You’ve really pushed yourself into thinking you’re always correct.” Harold notes as Hafid rushes him and the initial swing of the still sheathed sword is ducked before Harold brings out his own sheathed sword to block the next. “Why?” “Why? Because I must!” Hafid remarks as he shifts his grip until he’s holding the sword in two hands for more control. The vaguely falchion shaped sword is the kind of thing that chops and hews into things. But it’s minimally enhanced and still in its sheath, so there’s nothing more than a hollow ‘tok’ sound when it crashes into the sheath of Harold’s sword. “You are human! You cannot possibly understand!” “Then explain it to me. Even if I cannot truly comprehend, at least let me know the words!” Harold says as he deflects a trinity of sword swings then ducks as Hafid extends his wings to try and chop him in the face. His sheathed sword then smacks into Hafid’s left ankle as the entire sweep of the wings was a distraction to force Harold into a position to get kicked in the face. But Harold is a fast bastard and has good reflexes. “Well parried. And the reason I must use threats, force and indeed a truly unpleasant manner of settling debate and conflict is that I am not respected otherwise. I am not part of a military, I am not some flippant fool gallivanting from place to place with an entire army and a uniform to back it up. I must earn my respect, and most take one look upon my fur and all notion of dignity and consideration is cast to the winds.” “Why do you care what others think of you? If they’re so short sighted and stupid as to judge you for what part you play in reproduction then why are you even speaking to them?” Harold asks as he jabs at Hafir. He’s still holding onto the sheath of his sword and trying to smack the Sonir with the cap of the handle. They are still being friendly after all. And drawing out his murderously strong weapon and reducing the man into a Rorschach test is far from friendly. “Because my duties are beyond that of simple violence. It is what I use to remove obstacles and drum up additional funding. But my goal is preservation and conservation. For that I need respect to at least buy sufficient time to clean any damages and reintroduce a broad enough gene-pool of healthy adults to any species that had been laid low by the carelessness and cruelty of people. Failure means extinction of innocent creatures, meaning potential peoples will never emerge and societies will never spin or develop into being. Surely you’ve seen it? Advanced animals on the cusp of some form of personhood nearing the edge of danger?” Hafir explains as he weaves away from Harold’s increasingly fast jabs. The two men are testing each other, moving faster and faster as they fight, but holding a clear and easily followed conversation as they do so. “This conservation is about more than nature?” Harold asks as Hafid shifts and uses the guard on his sword to tangle with Harold’s and there is a quick fight over who has control of the weapons.

Still, some things, the beings of the Terran Confederacy felt were better if they were 'real' and 'non-forged.' Smokey Cone and the Treana'ad believed that grain and milk, sugar and salt, and everything else that went into the wide array of ice cream flavors, was better if it was 'naturally grown and/or collected' rather than just forged up. Some of the more esoteric and expensive ice creams even bragged such things as \"Genuine Soft Handed Terran Milkmaids\" or \"Genuine Salt Mined by Pickaxe\" and \"Strawberries Grown Under the Light of a Yellow Sun\" for their premium taste and expense. The cattle in the fields, most of which were direct bloodline to the cattle taken by the legendary P'Thok in the Great Moo-Moo Raid almost nine thousand years ago, were lavishly pampered to a degree that bordered on outrageous. Petted, brushed, combed, hand fed, they were pampered out of the belief that an uncomfortable moo-moo would produce sour milk. The Cattle Queen watching over the moo-moo's as they were being brushed and pampered was ostentatious in her lavish outfit. Her dress was styled off of ancient Terran West Cattler style, with plenty of frills and lace, with a bustle that completely covered her abdomen and hid her legs beneath it's impressive size. Napping on the soft cloth of the bustle, basking in the sun, were a half dozen hatchlings smaller than a human's hand. Her bonnet was ornate, hand embroidered, shading her eyes and antenna from the warming rays of the large red sun. She even had a hand tooled leather pistol belt around her thorax/abdomen junction, complete with bullets and an ivory gripped pistol in the proper places. T'Nok knew it was all to show off her power and wealth, not only to any passerby's but to the moo-moo's themselves, to let them feel calm and protected by her wealth and power. He nervously cleaned his antenna as he moved up, guarded on either side by Rigellian females dressed in chaps, boots, and leather vests with moo-moo tender hats. They too had leather gunbelts, only where the Matron wore one, they wore two crossed, with heavy pistols riding in the holsters. The spurs on their leather boots (hand tooled, real leather, of course) chimed softly as they walked. The Cattle Queen Wi'Luki ignored T'Nok at first, reaching out to slowly pet the long nose of one of her moo-moo's that came over to the fence. The moo-moo quivered with delight as the bladearm gently brushed down from the moo-moo's eyes to the wet nose. After a moment it made the low sound they were famous for and ran off. \"Honored T'Nok,\" the Cattle Queen said, her voice almost lost in the sound of the wind. \"My congratulations on your elevation to Citizenship.\" \"I thank you, Matron,\" T'Nok said. \"I was surprised to see your request to meet with me. I had thought you were quite busy at this time,\" Wi'Luki said slowly, her affected drawl soft and pleasant to T'Nok's ears. \"I have taken some time off due to personal reasons,\" T'Nok said. \"The Terran,\" Wi'Luki said. It was not a question. \"My brother, yes,\" T'Nok said. The Matron turned and raised one antenna. T'Nok nodded. \"When I attended the University of Lumbering Meat Beasts Crossing Water in Bongistan, I was inducted into an ancient brotherhood that extends to before the Glassing. To be a member of this brotherhood, I attended ceremonies where I swore solemn oaths before our Elders, to"}

Got a 7mo old puppy who just doesn’t seem to care about her meals 🤣 I’ve tried everything and have just accepted that she’s just not a very hungry dog. Done the whole take it away after 15min, no other treats at all, tried other food/flavor, tried wet/dry, etc. she just doesn’t care! When she’s hungry she’ll eventually eat whatever is there. So unexpected for a cav! She’s still growing and has a ton of energy and is happy as a clam."}
