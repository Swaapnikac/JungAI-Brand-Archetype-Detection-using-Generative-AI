Four characters, each embodying one of the brand values of Freedom, Adventure, Authenticity and Passion, are the main protagonists of each episode. The new Jeep Avenger is the brand's first all-electric SUV and is now available also as an e-Hybrid version . It blends impressive technical features and capability with respect for the environment, perfectly encapsulating the brand’s four values. The Jeep ® brand was born more than 80 years ago during times of dire strain, and as a result, its identity was forged based on the four values of: freedom, adventure, authenticity, and passion. These are the universal values that define what the Jeep Brand is today, and which continue to guide the brand’s path towards the future. The new Avenger – the first-ever fully electric Jeep vehicle – is intended to stand out and reflect those brand's values. Unveiled a year ago, at the Paris Motor Show, the new Jeep Avenger, combines modernity and legacy, thanks to technologies that ensure superior capability without compromising environmental sustainability, and a compact yet spacious design that embodies the brand's essence in an ambitious vehicle, developed based on the brand's blueprint values: Freedom, Adventure, Authenticity and Passion. To showcase these attributes, the Jeep brand is currently distributing a new web series made up of four one-minute video episodes posted on YouTube. Each episode will revolve around one of the brand's four core values and will feature authentic and personal anecdotes from four Italian protagonists who take viewers on a journey to discover what the Jeep brand communicates through its vehicles, in line with the aspirations and ambitions of those who choose to trust their Jeep SUV. The initial episode takes viewers to the sky with Sandro Beni, in search of the meaning of Freedom ( Link ). As a parachutist, Sandro finds an indescribable sense of freedom in being one with his surroundings and feeling connected to nature. A feeling that the Jeep brand aims to ensure and prioritize owners, thanks to the new Avenger's environmental focus. Equipped with a 400-volt electric motor and a 54kWh battery, the new 100% electric Avenger blends high performance with zero carbon emissions. To provide the freedom that drivers desire, the Jeep brand has equipped its first 100% electric SUV with a 100kW fast charger, allowing for a minimum distance of 30 km after just three minutes of charging, and a battery recharge of 20% to 80% in just 24 minutes. The second episode focuses on Adventure ( Link ) and is set in the captivating mountainous surroundings of “Gole della Valserra” in Umbria. It showcases Szilvia Rados as the leading character, a 44-year-old woman who loves to explore the beauty of nature. She explains her understanding of adventure, which can be compared to the feeling of falling in love, as it accelerates the heartbeat and evokes unique emotions. She demonstrates why her Avenger is an essential travel partner, from its built-in navigation system - including the smartphone wireless screen mirroring to set map instructions - to its technical capabilities like the \"Selec-Terrain®\" and \"Hill Descent Control\" features, which makes the driving experience even safer and more enjoyable, enabling her to access destinations that bring her to life despite the harsh conditions, driving along unpaved roads in the same way that she handles the precipitous lines of the canyon. One of the Jeep brand's most prominent values, undoubtedly, is Authenticity, which has its roots in a long-standing tradition that stems from being the pioneer of the 4x4 SUV, allowing \"the beauty of the idea to become reality\", quoting Umberto Dattola, the designer involved in the third episode of the series ( Link ). The 53-year-old man gives viewers an exclusiv"}

For the 23rd year in a row, the Jeep brand is America’s most patriotic*, according to Brand Keys Most Patriotic Brands survey. Consumers who were surveyed assessed brands that best embody the value of patriotism in 2024. “Being recognized as America’s most patriotic brand for the 23rd consecutive year is a testament to our passionate owners and enthusiasts who whole-heartedly embrace the outdoor adventure and freedom that our Jeep 4x4s offer, which is second to no other,” said Bill Peffer, senior vice president and head of Jeep brand North America. To determine the 2024 rankings, Brand Keys surveyed more than 7,460 consumers, 18 to 65 years of age, balanced for gender and political affiliation, assessed 1,381 brands in 143 B2C and B2B categories, using Brand Keys emotional engagement measures. The assessments evaluated brand resonance for the single value of patriotism, and the Jeep brand was identified as the best for meeting today’s patriotism challenges. “Patriotism is one of the most powerful values a brand can own. Jeep has primary ownership of that value, with a real emotional underpinning. Jeep has a history forged in the past and the present,” said Robert Passikoff, president and founder of Brand Keys. “And if there’s such a thing as ‘patriotic DNA,’ it shows up in our Most Patriotic Brands emotional engagement assessments. In a more political and partisan marketplace, Jeep has been able to create a bond with all consumers, which is why Jeep shows up at the top of the list every year.” The Jeep brand and the USO are also marking 16 years together to help support and keep the members of the nation’s military connected to everything that gives meaning to their service.
