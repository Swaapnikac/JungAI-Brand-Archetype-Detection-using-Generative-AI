Have a question that we didn‚Äôt address? Call our support team at 1-800-726-7377 or contact us online. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS Are Pampers diapers and ingredients safe? Yes! All Pampers products are safe. Our diapers, wipes, and training pants use carefully evaluated ingredients that are common in most diapers and wipes and are safely used by millions of babies every day. What are the 4 Steps in the Pampers Safety Promise? The Pampers Safety Promise ensures that every element of our products are safe for baby. Step 1: Ensure Safety at the Source Step 2: Assess Manufactured Components Step 3: Evaluate Every Product Step 4: Monitor Again (and Again) How does Pampers ensure products are safe for my baby? Our safety team works with medical professionals and safety experts to evaluate every ingredient for potential risks. We also invest in clinical safety studies and monitor products through safety checks, both on the production line and at home. How do you choose Pampers‚Äô ingredients? Our ingredients are carefully chosen based on safety profiles and their demonstrated effectiveness for keeping baby‚Äôs skin dry and healthy. We evaluate every ingredient to ensure it‚Äôs safe before it ever comes in contact with your baby‚Äôs skin. Do diapers cause diaper rash? While diaper rash is one of the most common pediatric conditions, it is not caused by diapers. Diaper rash is caused by a combination of factors like excessive skin hydration, increase in pH, and irritants in bowel movements and friction. What is skin pH? pH is the level of which something is acidic or basic, on a scale of 1-14. Healthy infant skin ranges from 4.7-6, but urine and stool can increase the pH, making the skin more susceptible to rashes. What is a taped diaper? Taped diapers use strips (or ‚Äútape‚Äù) to secure the diaper to your baby‚Äôs waist. This allows for a custom and adjustable fit for your baby and can be especially useful for newborns whose umbilical cords have not fallen off. What are Pampers¬Æ Diaper Pants? Diaper pants are soft and stretchy. We‚Äôve designed these diapers for infants 6+ months old, especially those who are beginning to crawl and flip over. These diapers can be pulled on while your baby is standing up and have tear-away sides for easy removal. What‚Äôs in Pampers diapers? Pampers diapers are composed of a topsheet, stretchy fastenings, a dual acquisition layer and absorbent core, flexible leg cuffs and elastics, fun drawings, adhesives, and a waterproof backsheet. Some diapers also include a mild ointment and a wetness indicator. Will diaper adhesives come into contact with my baby‚Äôs skin? No. Adhesives are used throughout the diaper to keep the parts of the diaper together and avoid leakage. These adhesives are solvent-free and do not come into direct contact with your baby‚Äôs skin. How do diapers absorb all the moisture? Pampers diapers contain absorbent gelling material that can absorb nearly 30 times its weight. In rare cases, you may notice small gel particles on your baby‚Äôs skin‚Äîthis is the absorbent material and can easily be removed by wiping gently. What are gel beads? Are they safe if they touch my baby‚Äôs skin? These beads are part of our absorbent gelling material, which has a long history of safe use in diapers. If you notice small gel particles on your baby‚Äôs skin, it is the absorbent material and can be easily removed by gentle wiping. Is the gel safe in my baby's diaper? Like all materials and ingredients in our diapers, super-absorbent gel is safe as used in our diapers. Pampers conducts tests to evaluate the safety of this ingredient ‚Äî adding to the large body of evidence that shows the safety of this gel for babies' skin. Are Pampers diapers scented? Some Pampers diapers contain a small amount of fragrance within the diaper and away from baby‚Äôs s"}

Picture this… dad is out and about, enjoying quality time with his baby and the inevitable hits: diaper duty. Cue the search for a changing table, only for dad to learn there’s nowhere for him to change that stinky booty in the men’s restroom. It’s an all-too-familiar story that happens across the country, with Pampers research revealing that 9 out of 10 dads have gone into a public restroom that has not had a baby changing table*. Pampers recognizes dads are more hands-on than ever and wanted to help enable them to take the best possible care of their babies. In 2021, Pampers partnered with Koala Kare to install more than 5,000 changing tables across North America—in all 50 states and 7 Canadian provinces to more than 870 organizations! 1 According to a 2019 survey of 200 U.S. parents by Consumer & Market Knowledge for Pampers Changing table inequality was placed front and center in 2018, fueled by an image posted on social media of Florida father, Donte Palmer, with his child in his lap squatting to change his son's diaper. Since that post, which garnered national and international media attention, Palmer has founded #SquatForChange, an organization committed to arming dads with the proper changing table resources they need to be hands-on with their children. Palmer is working with Pampers to champion thousands of dads who have used social media to voice their desire to see changing table equality. Musician, activist and Pampers spokesperson, John Legend, will also help the brand introduce this commitment to hands-on dads. “I love being a hands-on dad, but it's definitely frustrating when I am out with Miles and the men's restroom doesn't have a baby changing table,” said John Legend. “And I know that it's not just happening to me, all dads face this inequality. It's staggering to me that in 2019 if dads want to change our baby's diaper in public we have to get creative – should we trudge back to our cars, squat and physically become the changing table like Donte Palmer, or limit our outings to the places we know there are changing stations? That's why I couldn't be more excited that Pampers is making this commitment – it's an acknowledgement of fatherhood and the important role dads play in their babies' lives.” 1 According to a recent survey of 200 U.S. parents by Consumer & Market Knowledge for Pampers 2 Based on retail sales"}
