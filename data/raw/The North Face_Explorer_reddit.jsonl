No videos. No movies. No moving ads—if I can help it. So far, that one has been the most difficult to avoid because many NYC subway cars and stations now have moving ads right in your face. Also I was at Grand Central Station the other day and they were everywhere. So I quickly averted my eyes. I only started 2 days ago and already my lizard brain went on auto pilot. I logged into Instagram for some reason and immediately began watching a video. I was half-way through it when I went \"oh shit!\" and turned it off. So strange. I literally had no conscious awareness of what I was doing until it was too late. But beyond those 5 seconds, I have not consumed any moving images in 2 days. I will allow myself to consume a moving image ONLY if required by my job. Will see how it goes.... Since there has been some interest in this, I thought I would update as I go along. Day 1 Aug 31 afternoon: Avert my eyes from multiple moving ads on MetroNorth, Grand Central, and the MTA. Sept 1: Watch about 5 seconds of an Instagram reel before suddenly realizing WTF I'm doing and shut it off 9/2: In the AM, I need to read a People magazine story for work. In the corner is a video (not an ad) that no matter what I do, I can't shut off. Forced to watch in the periphery of my vision while reading the article. Afternoon: Again went into an article and was forced to see about 2 seconds of a video in the corner of the article before I figured out how to turn it off. 9/3 - The hardest part by far is being an online participant and seeing moving images as I go to websites for work. They are even on sites (like my own) that did not used to have them. Even a Google search now brings up a video at the top of the search. So this has already happened a couple of times this morning. Each time, I quickly scroll past or avert my eyes. One of my browsers has an ad blocker on it, I will switch to that and see if it helps. As for long form moving images like movies or YouTube videos, the time I usually watch those is at night when I start cooking and then while I'm eating dinner. So now I cook to either silence or a podcast, and I eat while in silence or listening to a podcast. I can't read while eating as it is hard to turn the page. I have a foster kitten and use one hand to play with her. I find that the passive time I'd have my eyes glued to someone on my iPad is now better spent playing with her. 8:30 AM. I read something that made me think I should look it up on YouTube. I went to YT, and as all the video thumbnails loaded, I thought \"Holy shit, what am I doing?\" and closed out without watching a video. 10 seconds later: Clicked on a link that I thought would lead to an article but led to a TikTok video. Shut it off after a second or two. Need to switch to my browser with the ad/pop up blocker. Normally don't use it because it slows everything down, and I also miss things I need to see for my job. 8PM: Uploaded a story to Instagram for my cat foster account as my foster kitten went to her new home, watched it back and watched too far, someone else's story came on and it was moving! Sigh. 9/4 My foster kitten's new home sent me a video of her this morning. I of course clicked it and watched it several times and also sent it to some other people and posted it on Instagram, and am only now realizing (15 minutes later) that I watched moving images!! Sigh... But this is important stuff, seeing how my foster kitten of 3 months was doing in her brand new home. I know more videos will follow of her in her new home and how she is doing with her new resident cat friend. I don't know what to do exactly... 9/5 I've decided I will watch any text msg videos sent by my foster kitten's new home as those are more important than the experiment. I need to see how she is adjusting there and to watch her body language. Other than snippets I've consumed from videos playing"}

On its current trajectory $550-750 a share is a reasonable (my worthless opinion) price point, with or without the squeeze. Not only is buying GME a play on the squeeze, but also a deep fucking value bet. Fair warning, you'll develop a wrinkle of two if you proceed... but don’t worry my fellow ape brethren I’ve included charts, with colors, to make visualization easy. Let’s walk through these figures one by one and tell the story of Gamestop’s transition. \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* \\*Edit\\* also see latest update (4/1): [Our Whale is Suppressing Volatility to Bleed HFs -- Max Pain Explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mi1a5r/our_whale_is_suppressing_volatility_to_bleed_hfs/) # Chapter 1: Gamestop’s Advantage in its Transition to Online. Let’s start with the ugly before we get to the good stuff: **Operating Loss**. An operating loss occurs when a company's operating expenses exceed gross profits. Gamestop has had a fairly significant operating loss for many years now (peaking in 2018), as it faced the challenges all brick and mortar stores faced: theft of sales to the e-commerce giants -- the convenience of online downloads and pre-ordering on the internet. In the last two years, this loss has come down significantly. And what impresses me most about Gamestop is their cash on hand (currently $635M). Very few stores with operating losses have that level of cash. Most are in debt, and require the sale of shares to float by during rough times. &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/dyyd0zf7req61.png?width=1544&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3e553bc397243f7b97702eb68d52d1a462c1431 And this is the key misstep the HF’s made in shorting Gamestop. There has been a stigma out there about brick and mortar stores going under (Toys R Us, and Sears as example)... feeding frenzy, blood in the water you get the point. Sharks (HFs) have been getting more and more bold (reckless) in their targeting. Gamestop was the wrong target, for a very specific reason. It leases its stores. By comparison, consider Walmart needing to reduce stores, or Target. They’ve built massive buildings with parking lots to house their very specific store needs (huge upfront costs, sunk), and they rent (or own) these buildings under much different contracts. They can’t easily get up and leave one of their stores. Ask yourself, how would Walmart leave a store? Who would buy it? How could the investor renting to them turn it into something else? Maybe a city might want it to build an expo center. On the cheap. WalMarts costs are priced into this (it’s expensive). They can’t move as easily. Point being, Gamestop doesn’t owe anything to shut down a store, it simply stops paying its lease and moves all it’s stuff out. They rent strip mall locations and mall storefronts. This allows them to liquidate stores and downsize with little to no sunk costs. They can also reposition themselves much more efficiently. This is why we see this fast turn-around in Operating Loss last year (a major component of Operating Loss is storefront costs for Brick and Mortar). News of Gamestop closing stores isn’t bad news. Remember that. The media will try to sell it as such. Because of the focus, Gamestop is eyeing Digital Sales, for its future. # Chapter 2: Digital Sales Growth It is clear to everyone, at this point, that Gamestop is looking to move a large portion of its business into the online space. In 2020 Gamestop did $580Million in sales online, and in Q4 alone their online sales represented over 34% of all Gamestop sales; Gamestop did more in online sales in the 4th quarter of 2020 than it did in all of 2019. &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/80l9ei8breq61.png?wid"}

This is the only time that I've seen so many inverse things happen like this. * Giving a founder additional shares to do his job just to motivate him when the majority of his wealth is based on Tesla in the first place, Refreshers are normal and option plans are normal, but needing 1T worth of them is not. * They think that old Elon who used to captivate an audience through being progressive and promoting the future... will somehow return (not only has he lost steam for promising lofty ideas but people are finally tired of broken promises by him, every year its another almost there target for self driving. Also where is the new roadster?) * Everyone is tired of Elon standing on stage trying to compute how to speak as he jumps around and does salutes \"as a joke\" vs someone who sits back and builds out the company to its full potential * The company still caters to a a high end, well educated consumer for their products. As soon as he lost the base for it he did all the damage control he could. He literally tried to have Trump sell his cars on the Whitehouse green, that's how desperate its got for him crying on twitch (a gaming platform) about people hating him. * The board of directors is stacked in his favor but also is so fearful of him that they won't standup to him. They at least have enough of a spine to make sure he hits targets to get his package. Although he will never meet those goals so I guess if you are an Elon Supporter this is great news (your lord is staying around) if you are inbetween you know what you are getting and if you hate him, well he has a giant carrot Infront of him to do something. I think that the pay package is so strange as somehow he will recover the mess he created. If I joined a company (as Elon joined Tesla, he didn't create it) then got it to the position where he risked everything to make it the brand/success it is, then tanked it by his political/ketamine rants, then was offered 1T to act normal and bring it all back.... I'd be the luckiest person on earth. This story is bonkers. **I'd rather see they pay someone a 1 trillion dollar pay package to wipe Elon's image out of the Tesla picture or** associated with Elon. A rebrand to being progressive, for human rights, and a environmental company . This is the strangest pay package I've ever seen. The bottom line is, if they hired any reputable CEO that can re-establish the brand of being a modern, progressive company, they would be back on track, not trying to force this monstrosity back into its cage with money. Tesla in Europe, China, and even North America sales are steadily declining, tax credit offsets are ending, the company needs a new face, and Elon is the worst way to promote what was once the progressive movement. EDIT: To everyone saying that if they don't offer this up he'll leave and either start another competitor or destroy the brand. The issue is the brand is destroyed already by someone who tweets about illegal aliens and governement conspiracies all day and night. How has his ventures gone since he became the DOGE psychopath? XAi is a dumster fire of VC money, Boring Company has.... built a tunnel under vegas convention center that has human drivers for robo taxi's, sales have steadily declined, solar and battery have been taken over by other companies, uhhh what am I missing? Oh SpaceX.... if it wasn't for Gwynne Shotwell it would be a dumpster fire. He has promised so many things, and none if any have ever come to fruition."}

VF-Corp ## The Fall from Grace The stock has crashed 88% from its 2021 all-time high of $100 per share and is currently trading at $12 per share. What has changed,you may ask ? The sell-off can be attributed to all of these factors( in chronological order) : 1. Early 2019, VF Corp sold of their denim brands (Wrangler and Lee Jeans, now known as Kontoor Brands) as they thought they weren't core to their brand portfolio. Kontoor Brands have since shown resilient growth on the top and bottom line. 2. Dec 2020, they did a $2.1 billion debt-financed acquisition of Supreme, which has since resulted in approximately 800-900 million in impairment cost, and the company has yet to succeed in monetise the Supreme brand and synergise it with their other brands. 3. Over-ordering of inventories during COVID-19, resulting in the need to sell their Vans/Timberland/Dickies inventory at a discount. 4. Throughout 2022 to late 2023, Vans' sales deteriorated 15% year-over-year in 2022 and a further 22% year-over-year in 2023, resulting in an accumulated decline of 35% from peak Vans sales. 5. March 17 2022, FED begins rate hikes to curb inflation. Borrowing costs increased from 0.25% in March 2022 to 5.25% in July 2023. This affected the cost of financing for VFC given their growing debt pile and market participants reflected this by discounting the stock price. 6. In Dec 2022, Steve Rendle, the CEO at the time made a sudden exit from the company during a time of deteriorating sales. Company lost its direction and an interim CEO had to be put in place. 7. After 7 months, in July 2023, a new CEO, Bracken Darrell (former Logitech CEO), was put in place tasked to revitalise the brands, but he subsequently cut revenue and earnings guidance, cut the dividend yield from 4-6% ish to 0.9%, and declared multiple asset write-down. This further crashed the stock price, while the company announced the \"Reinvent\" program, a 4 year plan to bolster growth. 8. As of October 2023, VFC had become a debt-ridden company (7 billion in debt) with upcoming debt maturities to refinance, making it highly susceptible to interest rate fluctuations. The US 10-Year Yield at that time hit a 52-week high of 5% in October 2023, and the stock slid to $13 (-87% from ATH). 9. In April 2024, VFC was dropped from all S&amp;P 500-related indices and the FTSE All-World Index due to its market cap falling into the small-cap category, further contributing to the slide in the share price. 10. On April 11, 2024, the Consumer Price Index (a measure of inflation) was higher than expected, pushing back the need for the FED to cut interest rates, and VFC's stock slid to a 15-year low of $12 per share, last seen during the 2018 Financial Crisis. ## The Turnaround Opportunity Despite the deteriorating sales, I believe the bottom is near, and the company has all the necessary components for a turnaround.

Here is my story which may sound like a movie. So, this happened last year in mid-2024. We were all 21-22 year olds Engineering Students doing our summer internship at a renowned tech company in Noida. There was a 21 year old girl with us in the same company, who was pursuing [B.Tech](http://B.Tech) in Computer Science from one of the top colleges in Delhi (One of it from IIITD, DTU and NSUT). She was brilliant-with exceptional Coding skills and Tech knowledge, and was very hardworking. We were 5–6 students there from different colleges but we all quickly bonded well and became friends. That girl was pretty friendly, had a great sense of humour, smart and was very humble with everybody, and was gorgeous. She looked to hail from a well to do but grounded family. If I go in little detail: 1. She used to dress very well but not flashy and had 3-4 pairs of shoes that she repeated alternatively. All were from brands like Puma and Adidas. 2. She used an iPhone 13 Pro Max-an almost 3 year old model then as it was launched in 2021, and had Airpods as well as a Macbook. 3. She had amazing communication skills and spoke fluent English with a mix of modern slang and impressed us all with her knowledge—not just in tech, but also in geo-politics, economics, and even Sanskrit. She often quoted the Bhagavad Gita and would explain deep philosophical meanings from it, and all of were very impressed as well as initially surprised. As I'm into spirituality too, we both used to have a good time discussing many aspects of this and I learnt a lot from her. 4. She was very respectful towards everyone and used to speak to the Senior Engineers or the peon/security guard with the same politeness. 5. She used to reside in Noida itself and come to the Office via Metro and E-rickshaw. First, she to used to board from a Metro station nearest to her home in Noida, come to the nearest metro station of Office and then take an E-rickshaw to reach the Office which was about 2-3 kilometres away from the Metro station. In all, she seemed to come from an upper middle class family as per Delhi NCR standards-comfortable, but not ultra-rich. As many youngsters today own an iPhone (For example-I don't come from a rich family (maybe upper middle class) and myself owned an iPhone) and Airpods and branded Shoes, it was kind off ordinary and not something out of the World. Days and weeks passed. After the working hours, we all (5–6 people) used to eat the street food like Golgappe (that she loved the most) and Momo together after the office hours and were having a good time. She didn’t seem to be different from us at all in terms of financial background. Until one day. It was the time of mid-August, and there was a sudden and heavy rain at the evening right after the working hours. We were all standing near the gate inside the Office premises chit-chatting and looking at the rain and waiting for it to stop, but it didn’t give any such signs. 15-20 minutes passed but still, it was raining heavily. 2 people booked cabs and left. We were 4 people left now, when I asked her plans about leaving. She said she would wait for another 10 minutes and if she still couldn’t find any E-rickshaw, then she will “see”. As it was raining heavily, there were no E-rickshaws nearby too. (She used to take an E-rickshaw to the Metro station daily.) Neither the rain stopped nor she could find any E-rickshaw and 10 minutes passed. As I was observing her, she sent a text to somebody and right after a minute, got a call. She spoke something for 20 seconds or so and went near the gate and started walking back and forth there as she was waiting for someone. We all went there too and started chit-chatting among ourselves when, after around 10 minutes- a really long, white Car with the windows tinted pulled up right in front of her. We could see a well dressed chauffeur inside and as we could even process what was happening, the chauffeur q"}

Local Time: 1450 Hours.** I always knew Thalmin was a wolf, or at least, eerily reminiscent of one. Though there was little in the way of his actions (aside from the occasional tail-wag) that really, truly, spoke to his lupine heritage. Not in the way he acted, walked, or carried himself. Not even in the way he spoke. His vocalizations had always been filtered through the translation suite without any issues, though that generally meant that a lot of his *voice* was more than likely lost in the process. However the software *did* attempt to account for this, going so far as to punctuate each and every translated word with subdued interpretations of his wolf-like vocalizations, adding a distinct personal flair to the reconstituted speech. From growls to barks and even the occasional yap, all were integrated into the translated output seamlessly and without any issue. At least, that *had* been the case, until now. “Tatcha ti ka. Ultir nes len telrian, Emma?” The Lupinor mercenary prince all but *barked* out, and unlike before, I could actually *feel* the hefty bass and underlying rumbling that carried through the entirety of his speech. This was the first time I was hearing him completely unfiltered. However, this also meant that *this* first time I was hearing him, without actually *understanding* him. All of this could only mean one thing. *The translation suite was borked.* The mercenary prince continued to stare at me, blinking a few times, cocking his head to the side in confusion and awaiting a response that never came. It was at this point that my training kicked in *hard*, as I reached for my wrist-mounted data-pad, ready to plough through the diagnostics algorithm that had been seared into my head from the countless hours of field maintenance drilling. My fingers flew across the touchscreen, muscle memory kicking in as the proprietary UI was optimized for this very sort of thing: a quick and dirty debugging session that was designed to be as intuitive and as idiot-proof as possible. “Latchow kusi! Ha tal, ke ney sa?” The wolf continued, now playfully elbowing my armored shoulderguards, beaming out a wide smile as if trying to bridge the veritable chasm that had suddenly formed out of this inexplicable language barrier. Whatever Thalmin was trying to convey was lost on me, even though the context and the casualness of the friendly jab should’ve already clued me in to what was going on. “Ultir nes len telrian, Emma?” The wolf repeated, chuckling to himself a bit as he moved to stand beside me, proceeding to reach his arm over to drape it across my shoulders. “Ultir, Emma?” He reiterated, before snapping his head towards Thacea, beaming out an expectant grin as if egging her on to join in on what I was quickly surmising was a joke I wasn’t privy to. Thacea’s reactions confirmed my suspicions, as she looked on at Thalmin with a face of incredulity, completely unamused at the wolf’s antics. “Now isn’t the time for fun and games, Thalmin.” She sighed with a tone of resigned disappointment, before turning to face me. “Thamlin seems to be testing the limits of what he believes to be your… translation artifice, Emma. Evidently, his running theory is that speaking in a language and dialect completely separate from High Nexian would be sufficient in evading your translation artifice’s ability to comprehend what is being spoken.” "}

You won’t find it on Google Play or the App Store. There’s nothing about the game on any public websites, other than this cautionary post. It doesn’t matter whether you’re a good or a bad person. It indiscriminately chooses targets. The point is that you can’t avoid the game. Nobody can. You might hear a reverberating ding from your phone — a tolling bell of death from the depths of Hell. And then an incongruous window might pop up. &gt;“Can you hide?” &gt;‘Yes’ — ‘No’ When the window first appeared on my phone screen, I was stunned. I always presumed smartphones to be safer from the threat of viruses than computers. Especially a brand new iPhone. Isn’t Apple supposed to be superior to Microsoft when it comes to security? “Nice try,” I said. But before I made a rash decision and ended up infecting my phone with something nasty, I decided to do some research. I’m not exactly computer-savvy, but I didn’t trust either the ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ option. I didn’t want to mess with the window in any way. There was nothing about the ‘Can you hide?’ pop-up online. I didn’t even realise it was a game until a Reddit user, who I won’t name, pointed me in the direction of a Discord server for discussing unearthly matters. There was an entire category dedicated to the bizarre new game that had been appearing on people’s phones. Clicking ‘Yes’, apparently, commences a hide-and-seek game of unknown origin. I scrolled through the many Discord messages. I’ve removed the usernames. *User 1: Can anyone help me? Nobody seems to know anything about this game. My friend played it non-stop for a week, and then he went missing. That was two weeks ago. There are daily search parties, but I don’t think they’re going to find him. He said it wasn’t really a game. He said he saw a face outside his window.* *User 2: You have to select ‘No’.* *User 3: I destroyed my phone after reading these messages. Haven’t seen or heard anything unusual.* *User 4: I selected ‘No’, but I keep hearing creaks. And I don’t think it’s in my head.* *User 6: Just leave the pop-up window open, guys. You don’t have to select anything.* *User 5: What? For the rest of my life? What if something accidentally knocks it?* *User 3: Destroy your phone. Like I said, it worked for me.* *User 6: Until it pops up on your next phone.* *User 5: What if I just turn off my phone? That seems a little less dramatic than destroying it.* *User 3: Your funeral.* The more I read, the more anxious I felt. I had expected the pop-up window to be a virus, but everybody was telling ghost stories. *Stop being a superstitious baby*, I told myself. *That guy’s disappearance had nothing to do with the game he was playing*. Eventually, after a weekend of horrified contemplation, I opted for User 5’s idea to turn off my phone — in fact, I took it a step farther and reset my phone to its factory settings. I met my friends, Corey and Tanya, in a local park on Monday afternoon. I’d planned to tell them about my experience, but they beat me to the punch. “Why didn’t you pick up your phone all weekend, Lee?” Corey asked me. “We were worried about you, man! We wanted to hang out on Sunday.” “I didn’t fancy third-wheeling. Some of us have to go to work on Mondays,” I replied. “Hey! I work!” Corey protested. “From a bathrobe in your bedroom,” Tanya smirked. “You’re both just envious that I can scroll through Reddit and play games away from the watchful eye of my employer,” Corey said. “Speaking of games, Lee, have you played ‘Can you hide?’?” My heart plummeted, and I felt as if Corey’s words were cinder blocks, dragging my body though the floorboards. “He’s obsessed,” Tanya sighed. “He’s been playing it every day since Tuesday.” “It just popped up on my phone, so I thought, ‘Why the fuck not?’” Corey laughed. “Tanya thought it must be a virus, but it’s just a cool augmented reality game.” Corey thrust his phone down on the wooden picnic table. It was already open"}

I heard the bombs drop about an hour after my last post. The bunker shook so hard I thought it was going to collapse on me, but after the last explosion, the walls and the ceiling remained solid. Without Craig and his prepper tendencies I wouldn’t be alive right now. I didn’t know him too well, but I can’t let his death be in vein. When I first got in here, the creatures continued pounding on the door relentlessly, but to my relief none of them had managed to make their way into the bunker before I did. After the final bomb dropped, the outside world went silent. From inside the bunker, it seemed like the creatures hadn’t even made a dent in the thick metal door that separated me from them. After hours of listening for any activity outside the door, I collapsed onto the bed. Craig had installed a single cot which wasn’t particularly comfortable, but with the sense of a seemingly safe environment to lay down in and the fact that it was a hell of a lot more comfortable than the wooden floor in the attic, I managed to fall asleep. I had vivid nightmares of the creatures that night and woke up in a cold sweat. I opened my eyes and was looking directly up at the ceiling. I tried to lift my head, but something stopped me. My body was stiff and rejected every signal I gave it to move, it felt heavy, like gravity had increased 10 fold and I was stuck. That’s when I noticed in the corner of my eye, the dark figure that stood in the opposite corner of the room. Its shadow cast by the small battery operated light on the wall next to me, I struggled to make out who or what it was that had found its way into this safe place I thought I had secured. The figure started moving towards me and my heart skipped a beat. The figure’s face became illuminated by the light, and its huge sunken eyes stared back into mine. I wanted to scream. I wanted to jump out of the bed I was helplessly lying in and do something about the situation I had found myself in, but the closer the creature got to me, the less control I felt I had over my own body. Its tall form reached higher than most professional basketball players, with its head nearly touching the bunker’s relatively low ceiling. At this range I could make out more details about the creature. Tightly bound to its thin body, the creatures dark skin appeared charred, its huge eyes remained the only recognisable characteristic on its face, and its long, sharp, finger like claws taunted me. The creature arched its head down towards me and its face grew closer to mine. It felt as though the creature was sucking the soul from my body. The sheer terror I felt and the malicious force this creature exuded forced me to squeeze my eyes closed and wait for the inevitable to occur. But nothing happened. Moments passed and I waited... still nothing. I opened my eyes again and the creature was gone, I tried to get off the bed and my body finally responded, the weight that held me down had suddenly lifted. Completely shaken, I examined the place the creature had been before I closed my eyes and found no trace. The creature had vanished… or maybe it was never there in the first place. But it felt so real. I’d never experienced sleep paralysis before, but those creatures had an unimaginable effect on my psyche it seemed. I couldn’t continue sleeping after that ordeal, I got up completely and made the bed. I decided to take an inventory of what Craig had bought for this place. He wasn’t lying a"}

Madison Cawthorn (R-NC) was caught attempting to bring a loaded 9mm handgun through airport security in North Carolina—for the second time. Law enforcement [said](https://twitter.com/CMPD/status/1519027485568028673?s=20&amp;t=VH9CZkrkJ7gtqYHl1DOTsg) TSA agents discovered the gun in Cawthorn’s bag on Tuesday. The lawmaker admitted it was his firearm and was issued a citation for “Possession of a Dangerous Weapon on City Property, which is a City of Charlotte Ordinance.” &gt;Mr. Cawthorn was released, and the CMPD took possession of the firearm, which is normal procedure… It is standard procedure for the CMPD Airport Division to cite in lieu of arrest for the misdemeanor charge of Possession of a Dangerous Weapon on City Property unless there are other associated felony charges or extenuating circumstances. A little over a year ago Cawthown [tried](https://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/2021/07/30/asheville-airport-police-tsa-take-cawthorns-gun-likely-fined/5433797001/) to bring a different handgun through Asheville Regional Airport security on his carry-on bag. &gt;Cawthorn, whose spokesman responded to questions July 30 saying he brought the gun by mistake, was not charged with any crime, according to reports and other information on the incident obtained this month through a public records request. That is a normal outcome, said airport spokeswoman Tina Kinsey… &gt;The Republican-majority state legislature stripped a joint Asheville-Buncombe County board of oversight of the airport in 2012. The General Assembly gave control to a new Greater Asheville Regional Airport Authority, which makes it owns rules. Those say \"it shall be unlawful for any person, except those persons to the extent authorized by federal law and/or state law, to carry or transport any firearm or weapon on the airport property except when such firearm or weapon is properly encased for shipment.\" &gt;Breaking that law is considered a criminal misdemeanor, according to airport ordinances. It was not clear why the eight people, including Cawthorn had not been charged. --- #Knives Cawthorn also had a streak of allegedly carrying knives on to school properties last year, even after warnings from local law enforcement. Bringing knives onto school grounds is a class 1 misdemeanor in North Carolina. First, on Sept. 13, Cawthorn [carried](https://www.wspa.com/news/local-news/rep-cawthorn-warned-after-bringing-knife-to-henderson-co-school-board-meeting/) a fixed-blade dagger under his wheelchair to a Henderson County Board of Education meeting where he spoke against COVID-19 safety mandates. The Henderson County Sheriff’s Office issued a “verbal warning” to Cawthorn. A day later, Cawthorn was [photographed](https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/article254255723.html) with a Microtech brand serrated knife outside a school board meeting in Johnston County during a mask mandate [protest](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/education/article254208798.html). The lawmaker then reportedly tried to enter the building where a metal detector picked up the weapon. &gt;Capt.

But athletes aren't skilled workers, they are performers, and their work is to entertain a *specific audience*. The audience IS the work in this equation! Both Beyonce and Justin Bieber perform live music, but they are not doing equal work even though significant portions of their audience may overlap. &amp;#x200B; * In the sports industry, revenue is generated not by the volume of goals scored, but by the volume of people willing to pay to watch it happen and buy products branded to their teams and heroes. &amp;#x200B; * The men's World Cup in Russia generated over [$6 billion](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/sports/fifa-revenue.html) in revenue, with the participating teams sharing [$400 million](https://www.goal.com/en-us/news/world-cup-2018-prize-money-how-much-do-the-winners-get-countries-/h9rstxkx3z6k1c8eonct5g1xa), less than 7% of revenue. Meanwhile, the Women's World Cup is expected to earn [$131 million](https://resources.fifa.com/image/upload/fifa-financial-report-2017.pdf?cloudid=pinrmrodexmnqoettgqw) for the full four-year cycle 2019-22 and dole out $30 million to the participating teams... just shy of 23% of revenue. Factoring in the WWC's total team roster at 24 v.s. the MWC's roster of 32, the per-team-per-player revenue share is substantially higher for the Women's teams. &amp;#x200B; * Claims that the Women's team in the US brings in more money than the Men's team is cherry-picked data. This is true for the past few years, but over the long term, the more established men’s game brings in consistently higher game revenue year over year. &amp;#x200B; * Revenue sharing does not scale linearly; a fixed percent of revenue for both Men's and Women's tournaments is thus an unfair risk to the governing corporate body (it pains me to say this -- I hate FIFA just as much as everybody). In other words, committing 10% of $100 million in expected revenue is a much greater financial liability than committing 10% of $1 Billion. &amp;#x200B; * Molly Levinson, the spokesperson for the women’s national team said, regarding their lawsuit, “These athletes generate more revenue and garner higher TV ratings but get paid less simply because they are women.” The data disagree. While the women’s team [broke viewing records](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/07/sports/soccer/womens-world-cup-final-was-most-watched-soccer-game-in-united-states-history.html?module=inline) in the US during the WWC, ratings for men’s games have been more than double those for women’s games, on average, since 2012, according to Nielsen calculations. Excluding World Cup games, the men’s team’s ratings are almost four times as high. &amp;#x200B; * The US Soccer Federation is genuinely good at rewarding top talent regardless of gender. According to figures provided by U.S. Soccer, since 2008 it has paid 12 players at least $1 million. Six of those players were men, and six were women. The b"}

Elon’s TweetThreats and PP posts aside, EV stocks are melting faces this month. Consider the following… * Rivian IPO blew up. Share price $110. Now $98B market cap. * Tesla +120% since May. SP $1,190. Now $1.2T MC. * Lucid +100% in three weeks. SP $52. Now $86B MC. Like you, SoFi didn’t fill my $RIVN IPO order. Nor did I catch the $LCID $15 dip.

It’s now coming to market at a $20B valuation with $GGPI in Q1 2022.

That’s *Polstjärnan* (literal translation, “Pole Star”) if you’re Swedish. * Polestar was started in 1996 by Volvo’s partner, Flash/Polestar Racing. * Volvo acquired Polestar in 2015. Volvo had itself been acquired in 2010 by Geely, a China-based auto brand that sells vehicles under the brands Geely Auto, Lotus, Lynk &amp; Co, Proton, and Volvo. Geely sold over 2.4 million cars in 2020. * Volvo and Geely describe the Polestar brand as being “independent since 2017.” * Polestar is co-owned by Volvo and Geely, and headquartered in Gothenburg, Sweden. * Polestar is now being taken public at a $20B valuation by the Gores-Guggenheim, ticker GGPI. **Comps** **GGPI is trading at a significant discount to TSLA and LCID, based on EV/sales multiples.** * Applying Tesla’s 2023E multiple to Polestar implies a share price of $42.51 As GGPI is currently trading at $13.72, this yields an increase of 210%. * Applying Lucid’s 2023E multiple to Polestar implies a share price of $47.58. As GGPI is currently trading at $13.72, this yields an increase of 247%. &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/vrmfi8ga7d181.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c0a7af961e3f7ee4e20df9747b005fbff44af7d **Peer Multiples -- EV Pure Plays** * GGPI is essentially valued at the same forward multiples as XPEV and NIO. * Bear in mind, XPEV and NIO are higher-risk companies that deserve valuation discounts because: 1. The CCP can theoretically shut them down at any moment without warning (see: $DIDI). 2. The stocks are actually ADRs and based in the Cayman Islands, so you don't even own the actual companies. * By comparison, GGPI is headquartered in Sweden and already US-listed on the Nasdaq. * Polestar is already an established OEM, leveraging the strategic relationship with Volvo in manufacturing, design and marketing. Hence, the investment opportunity is lower risk since Polestar is not a start-up. * As with most present-day multinationals, there is some China-related production risk. However, Polestar is addressing the issue by opening US factories going forward. https://preview.redd.it/n5mgt00e7d181.png?width=588&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7487924a42825ba052899aa03fc4fae3d1abe9ec **Gores' Deals** Gores’ track record speaks for itself… https://preview.redd.it/t1uq0jcg7d181.jpg?width=1972&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6571264d9347fd8f8c237881e1d511b8cca7fae **The EV Graveyard** The EV battlefield is littered with bodies.

But he doesn’t realize he reveals more than he realizes. Feel free to save this post as a reference. Much has been written about the content, but less on what it reveals about Harry’s perceptions about himself. (Forgot this in my drafts folder, but Engdame and Harry’s lawsuits certainly make Spare relevant for another varying account.) Here’s some **fascinating recent background from the ghostwriter**: * he spent a lot of time living at Montecito: [https://archive.ph/2023.05.08-190000/https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/meghan-markles-kind-gesture-prince-29927969](https://archive.ph/2023.05.08-190000/https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/meghan-markles-kind-gesture-prince-29927969) * even he was fighting with Harry for plausibility (reading between the lines, Harry wanted to sound like a GI Joe / Call of Duty war hero, especially the military sections). This fits with cutting 400 pages. * he’s been quoted saying Harry learns “at a glacial pace”. This implies frustration reasoning with him over inclusions, revisions, and edits. Harry’s brand identity he’s promoting (and believes) is: grieving son, brave and accomplished soldier, cheeky lad, lonely family member, victim of the Royal family, loather of the press, heroic husband. Current brand emphasis on thriving and faintly messianic, David vs Goliath press, humanitarian carrying on his mother’s legacy. Harry is likely not a narcissist (although Meg shows traits, and has the childhood risk factors). I can see why some symptoms may flag initially, but there are likely significant other mental health issues going on with Harry. For a general armchair speculations of H’s mental state, can add in the comments, if requested. What stood out to me from Spare: 1. **He NEVER takes accountability for his actions.** Glosses over breakups with Chelsea as a soldier off to war narrative, can’t see it working long term but he never seems to communicate that with her. His ‘second parents’ in Botswana have to physically sit him down with her to get him to admit to there is no future. Implies she feels the same, yet why would she continually go back with him if she didn’t think there was some future? Irony unlike other girls she “doesn’t fit herself with a crown upon meeting \\[him\\].” Same with Cressida. They are dating for two years. He’s turning 30. Yet he suddenly has an epiphany on a North Pole trek she’s not the one. She cries, and he glosses over it as mutual. Like with Chelsea, a friend literally had to tell him to end things. He was also with Cress during those infamous Vegas photos (where in separate media accounts he hooked up with two women), but conveniently leaves his cheating out of his narrative. Conflict avoidant, but far more likely egocentric inconsiderate. He taunts the woman at school with a back problem (disability) to make his friends laugh and justifying it still, as an adult. No shame or guilt. Telling like a cheeky lad story assuming it will charm people and make them like him through shared laughter. He doesn’t like her because she’s “not hot” and holds them accountable for their behavior. Fascinatingly, there is no remorse expressed with this story. He still assumes the reader will laugh along with him like his childhood friends did, as children. His history teacher is so frustrated with his lack of interest in learning about his own historical relatives, he gives him a ruler with picture and dates on it to help him remember. Harry finds this insulting, vs out of his way to try to see if it might ignite more of a passion for his own family history. Post Oprah interview, his mates and his “second family” in Botswana all express sympathy but also chide and challenge him for his hypocrisy in going public - essentially to the press.

Time to have some fun😈 I’m new to this sub reddit, but I’ve seen enough RSlash videos on YouTube to know how these stories go. A brief background, I’m middle eastern who live in the United Arab Emirates in the capital of Abu Dhabi. I’m a local but I don’t look it as my mother is from Egypt, and I would get mistaken for other nationalities often. On to the story: My niece got a new pet about a month ago from one of her friends, a 5 month old german shepherd, and she’s the cutest thing ever imo. Unfortunately, the friend didn’t bring enough food for the puppy, so I went the next day to a hypermarket nearby to buy some for her. I was told she liked a particular brand, so I decided to go inside without a cart or basket to see if they had it, then go back out for a cart. On my way to the pet food isle I heard shouting and yelling from close by and out of curiosity I went to check it out. I saw one of the workers and a wild Karen. While she didn’t LOOK like a Karen, she sure as hell ACTED like one, screaming at the poor guy about how “incompetent and rude he is”, and “ignoring her when she was trying to get his attention”, and of course, she was yelling for a manager. That’s when she turned around and locked eyes with ME, and made a beeline to where I was. Now keep in mind the workers uniform is a yellow or light blue shirt with the hypermarket name on it in big letters, and the managers wear full suits, I was wearing black jeans and a dark blue shirt. Also, majority of the staff were either from India or the Philippines. Now for the cast OL: obnoxious lady, PW: poor worker, M: manager, Me: yours truly. OL: You, manager, this employee of yours was very rude to me, he ignored me when I was trying to get his attention for 10 minutes and is refusing to help me and yelled at me, I want him FIRED. The first thought that came to mind was to tell her that I didn’t work there, but after seeing the condition PW was in, I decided to have some fun. Now my English has a good American accent, but I also have a fairly decent Indian accent, so without hesitation I switched my accent to Indian mode. Me: I’m so sorry madam, we’ve had many complaints about this problem worker, don’t worry, I will discipline him. And as a form of apology, please go about your shopping and at the cashier, just give them my name, Roger Patel, and tell them I approved a 40% discount on the total sum for you. OL: At least management knows how to treat PAYING customers. I went to PW, grabbed his arm and started walking away, “berating” him along the way until we made a turn and we were out of sight of OL, that’s when the PW said: Am I in trouble? It seems PW was new and also mistook me for a manager, and he thought he was going to be fired (poor guy). Me(laughing): I’m not a manager and you’re not in any trouble, I just wanted to get you away from her. And I walked away waving goodbye at him. I grabbed a cart, and went on to buy my puppy her chow and some other things for her (some toys, a new collar, a leash and a comfy bed), and some other items for myself. After I grabbed what I needed I made my way to the cashier, that’s when I heard a familiar screaming and yelling, and sure enough there was OL, arguing with one of the cashiers and an actual manager, trying to convince them that she was allowed the huge discount on all her items (a full carts worth), while I was laughing on the inside. Then she spotted me, pointed at me and yelled, OL: That’s him, that’s Roger Patel, the manager who approved my discount. The manager and cashier both looked at me with confusion in their eyes, and the manager said, M: Ma’am, this gentleman doesn’t work here. OL: Yes he does, why else would he give me the discount? He was even disciplining one of your workers. M and OL made their way to me, and I acted like I didn’t know what was going on. M, pointing at OL: Excuse me sir, do you know this lady?

They lay unnoticed and untouched for 5 years. Who was this travelling Frenchman? In 2017, the skeletal remains of a [male](https://imgur.com/a/Sz8dMv8) were located in a disused barn near Micheldever, Hampshire, UK. In 2019 witnesses came forward stating the male was a French traveller, whom they met in 2012. It is believed he died shortly after this meeting. Despite various tests, including fingerprint and DNA testing, he is yet to be identified. **The body in the barn** On 1st December 2017, units from Hampshire Constabulary were searching the Micheldever area as part of an unrelated investigation when officers came across an old and disused barn. Officers entered and searched the barn when they located the skeletal remains of an unknown male. The barn itself was a disused cattle shed, which formed part of the abandoned Borough Down Farm. The site was heavily overgrown and had not been used for over 50 years. Due to the remote location of the barn, it is unlikely any persons would be passing by other than the occasional dog walker. [Here](https://imgur.com/a/vW8EilO) you can find a photo of the barn in its proximity to Micheldever, a small village 6 miles north of Winchester. As you can see it’s a fairly rural location, adjacent to the train line which runs south to Winchester and north to Basingstoke. [Here](https://imgur.com/a/g2zEqdf) is a bird’s eye view of the area itself. The area is largely overgrown with trees and bushes; several buildings can be seen in this overgrown area and it is not clear which building is the barn in question. There is no photo available of the front of the barn itself. Clothing found with the remains were a pair of Wellington Boots (size 10), a blue zip-up fleece jacket, a blue jumper, and jogging trousers. Although not stated, the reconstruction shows the male also wearing a grey beanie hat. The blue jumper found on the remains contained a label with the words ‘casual sportif’ and the image of a fleur-de-lis. I’ve been unable to find whether ‘Casual Sportif’ is the brand or simply a line of clothing (meaning ‘sporty-casual’). The French words and image of the fleur-de-lis however implies the clothing is of French origin. Several further items were found alongside the skeletal remains, including: · A sleeping bag · A black Karrimor rucksack · An umbrella · An A-Z map of Great Britain. Written on the front of the book is “Waterloo – Winchester. £27.20/2”. · The novel ‘The Close’ by Marina Cole, released in 2006 · Reading glasses · White t-shirt · 4/5 white flannels · 2 packets of polos · A pack of Germolene (anti-septic cream) · Garden trowel · A pair of yellow gardening/outdoor gloves and a pair of black cotton gloves. · Flask · Torch · A Sony Walkman-style radio · Tobacco and rizla papers · Various food wrappers · A pack of Zantac (to relieve heartburn and indigestion. In 2020 the FDA removed Zantac globally due to its link to cancer seen in animals). No form of identification was found with the remains Whilst not all items have had photos released to the public, all available photos of these items can be found [here](https://imgur.com/a/4gLin4P). **Investigation and identity** A post mortem examination was conducted on the remains which showed no signs of assault or restraint. Although no cause of death could be identified, due to the lack of apparent suspicious circumstances, the corner ruled that it was likely the male died from natural causes. The coroner stated he would have died *at least* a year prior to discovery. The male was determined to be middle aged, although possibly older, 5’6-5’7 in height, medium build, with short brown hair and a narrow face. He was also believed to possibly have an overbite. It was also stated the male had good dental care in his younger life, however poorer dental health in his later life – there is no further information regarding this statement. Various"}

He announced I would take my place as his Luna, not out of love, but because the law demanded it. But the moment a frantic mind-link came through that his precious Seraphina--my adopted sister, the one who framed me--was having trouble breathing, he abandoned me without a second glance. That night, huddled in a dusty shack, I overheard my own parents' secret conversation. They were planning to have me exiled. Permanently. My return had upset Seraphina, and her \"weak heart\" couldn't take the shock. I lay there in the darkness, feeling nothing. Not surprise. Not even pain. Just a profound, empty coldness. They were casting me out. Again. But as they plotted my exile, a secret message arrived for me--an offer of escape. A new life in a sanctuary far to the north, where I could leave the Blackmoon Pack behind forever. They thought they were getting rid of me. Little did they know, I was already gone. Chapter 1 No.1 Elara POV: The heavy iron door groaned open, its protest echoing in the damp stone cell that had been my world for seven years. Light, sharp and unfamiliar, sliced through the gloom, forcing me to squint. My muscles, atrophied from long disuse and poor nutrition, trembled as I pushed myself to my feet. A sharp, searing pain shot up my right leg, a permanent reminder of the silver shackle that had once bound me here. It had left me with a limp, a constant, nagging ache that was now a part of who I was. \"Elara.\" The voice was deeper than I remembered, stripped of the warmth it held in my childhood memories. It was a voice that resonated with power, a sound that made the very stones seem to vibrate. It was the voice of my mate. My Alpha. Kaelen stood silhouetted against the blinding light of the doorway. He was taller, broader, his presence filling the cramped space with an oppressive energy. The scent of him--a potent mix of winter pine and the clean, sharp air before a storm-- flooded my senses, a scent that should have brought comfort but now only felt like a cage. \"The elders have agreed to your release,\" he stated, his tone flat, devoid of any emotion. He took a step inside, his dark eyes scanning my frail form with an unnerving detachment. \"As per the laws of the Moon Goddess, you are still my fated mate. You will take your place as my Luna.\" I said nothing. My heart, a tired, worn-out muscle, gave a feeble flutter and then settled back into its slow, rhythmic beat. The bond between us, that sacred connection the Goddess bestowed upon mated pairs, was a phantom limb. It was there, a dull throb in the back of my soul, but it was fractured, scarred over from the day he stood by and watched them drag me to this dungeon. He seemed to take my silence as acquiescence. \"Your parents... the pack elders, could not be here. Seraphina is unwell. Her heart condition has flared up again.\" Seraphina. The name was like ash in my mouth. My adopted sister. The one whose place I was born to take, but who had stolen everything from me instead. A bitter laugh threatened to escape my lips, but I swallowed it down. I was the true-born daughter of the pack's Beta, a direct descendant of the Alpha bloodline. Yet, at birth, a mistaken prophecy had labeled me an Omega, the lowest of the low. My parents, in their grief and disappointment, had adopted Seraphina, the orphaned daughter of the Gamma, and showered her with the love and status that should have been mine. I was forced to yield everything to her--my toys, my training, my position. And finally, my freedom. I had taken the fall for her, accused of conspiring with rogues, a crime she had committed. And Kaelen, my own mate, had believed the lie. \"Come,\" he said, turning his back to me, assuming I would follow. I did. One slow, limping step at a time, I followed him out of the darkne"}

I had a IDWHL moment and thought I should share it. I'll apologize for the bad formatting I'm on mobile. So I do my grocery shopping in a small lakeside brewery town. You know what I mean, The North Face jackets, Ugg boots, leggings and leg warmers, brand new pick up trucks with light bars, new Lincolns, Subarus with kayak racks and fat tire bike's. You know that type of town with rude attitudes of people who act like they've never worked a day in their life? Well here's my IDWHL story involving said town. When I got to the store, the parking lot was packed, nice cars everywhere along with shopping carts scattered. Im friendly with some of the people that work at the store so I grabbed two carts and took them inside. I should note that I'm wearing black dress pants and a pink long sleeve button up blouse with silver buttons with a grey zip up hoodie, I also don't carry a purse. (The uniform for this grocery store is black shoes black pants and a black short sleeve polo.) I leave one of the carts in the entrance and continue inside. Right away this woman puts her hand on the front of my cart and tries to pull it away. I'll call her CL for crazy lady CL \"Oh thank you so much, there aren't any carts left inside.\" Me \"Uh sorry this one is mine.\" Trying to pull it back. CL \"Well maybe you should get a different one.\" Me \"Yeah there's always that option, but I don't work here.\" Still pulling on my cart. CL \"Listen here young lady that is my cart I saw it first when you brought it in to drop it off.\" Her children are starting to cry and scream which doesn't make anyone's day better. \"Listen, I need this cart NOW.\" Me \"Umm?\" CL \"Don't just stand there looking at me like an idiot, give me my damn cart!!\" Me \"Excuse me, but this is my cart, I brought it in from outside for the specific reason of using it.\" CL \"Well go get another one! I have shopping to do!\" At this point she's yanking on my cart. Me \"What the hell are you doing?\" I'm aggravated. CL looks at me with the angriest face possible and starts to almost shout \"This is MY CART.\" Me \"Listen Broomhilda, this is my shopping cart! I don't work here go outside and get one!\" CL \"I'm going to report you! You'll lose your job. You've been very rude!\" Me \"Good, report me, after you report me how about you go fuck yourself?\" I pulled the cart away, shoved passed her and did my shopping. The lady comes up to me again this time with a store employee. She's going on and on about how rude I was to her and how I should be fired. The guy looks at me and convinces CL that I do in fact not work there and never have. It's not great but I thought it would do good here. Broomhilda is something my Dad always called bitchy women. I'm not sure what it means but it sounds offensive enough. Edit For the three of you who were complaining that I accidentally spelled lose with two o's, I have fat thumbs. Soorry Edit Wow I had no idea this would be so popular! For those of you asking what happened to the other shopping cart, I'm not sure I was a little preoccupied with the woman."}

On its current trajectory $550-750 a share is a reasonable (my worthless opinion) price point, with or without the squeeze. Not only is buying GME a play on the squeeze, but also a deep fucking value bet. Fair warning, you'll develop a wrinkle of two if you proceed... but don’t worry my fellow ape brethren I’ve included charts, with colors, to make visualization easy. Let’s walk through these figures one by one and tell the story of Gamestop’s transition. \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* # Chapter 1: Gamestop’s Advantage in its Transition to Online. Let’s start with the ugly before we get to the good stuff: **Operating Loss**. An operating loss occurs when a company's operating expenses exceed gross profits. Gamestop has had a fairly significant operating loss for many years now (peaking in 2018), as it faced the challenges all brick and mortar stores faced: theft of sales to the e-commerce giants -- the convenience of online downloads and pre-ordering on the internet. In the last two years, this loss has come down significantly. And what impresses me most about Gamestop is their cash on hand (currently $635M). Very few stores with operating losses have that level of cash. Most are in debt, and require the sale of shares to float by during rough times. [Gamestop Operating Loss per Year](https://preview.redd.it/4e698fbbneq61.png?width=1579&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a7de50dda8fa00983cdec3285c1025a9ad83ca5) And this is the key misstep the HF’s made in shorting Gamestop. There has been a stigma out there about brick and mortar stores going under (Toys R Us, and Sears as example)... feeding frenzy, blood in the water you get the point. Sharks (HFs) have been getting more and more bold (reckless) in their targeting. Gamestop was the wrong target, for a very specific reason. It leases its stores. By comparison, consider Walmart needing to reduce stores, or Target. They’ve built massive buildings with parking lots to house their very specific store needs (huge upfront costs, sunk), and they rent (or own) these buildings under much different contracts. They can’t easily get up and leave one of their stores. Ask yourself, how would Walmart leave a store? Who would buy it? How could the investor renting to them turn it into something else? Maybe a city might want it to build an expo center. On the cheap. WalMarts costs are priced into this (it’s expensive). They can’t move as easily. Point being, Gamestop doesn’t owe anything to shut down a store, it simply stops paying its lease and moves all it’s stuff out. They rent strip mall locations and mall storefronts. This allows them to liquidate stores and downsize with little to no sunk costs. They can also reposition themselves much more efficiently. This is why we see this fast turn-around in Operating Loss last year (a major component of Operating Loss is storefront costs for Brick and Mortar). News of Gamestop closing stores isn’t bad news. Remember that. The media will try to sell it as such. Because of the focus, Gamestop is eyeing Digital Sales, for its future. # Chapter 2: Digital Sales Growth It is clear to everyone, at this point, that Gamestop is looking to move a large portion of its business into the online space. In 2020 Gamestop did $580Million in sales online, and in Q4 alone their online sales represented over 34% of all Gamestop sales; Gamestop did more in online sales in the 4th quarter of 2020 than it did in all of 2019. &amp;#x200B; [Gamestop: Online Sales Growth by Year](https://preview.redd.it/rsvos30pneq61.png?width=1530&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2edf09bb5bd5d1de86557b06c28b938c4f3dcbd7) So what caused this?

And then some teams are just lame weather reports (Heat, Suns, Thunder), while others are entertainment industry advertisements (Magic, Raptors, 76ers). And then there are all dum animal names that are completely interchangeable. The point is each franchise has to move and not just swap names but take their entire organization with them, players and all. Judging criteria is simple: * Clearly a better fitting name for the city. * Should be inspirational for what the city wants to be perceived as. * Or, let’s be honest, most of these will not make any sense at all. I’m just chasing a perfect loop here. Let’s start this one off with 2020 Champs: Lakers! - **LAKERS**. Sure, it would make sense to send this team back to Minnesota where they have more lakes than black people, but there is another place where “lake” is literally in their official city motto. “Mistake by the Lake” **CLEVELAND LAKERS**(sorry Bron) - **CAVALIERS**. This team name is a weird reference to a bunch of US presidents being born in Ohio. But when we think of Ohio, do we think of failed rust belt cities, unemployment and poverty, urban decay, opioid crisis, or do we think of the POTUS? Come on! **WASHINGTON CAVALIERS** - **WIZARDS**. The whole nerd lore of wizards and spells and trolls and magic is of European origin dating back to illiterate medieval surfs being afraid of wooded areas. Make up your own fables US! New Orleans voodoo? Now that’s some proper spicy home brewed shit! **NEW ORLEANS WIZARDS** - **PELICANS**. Sure, that’s Louisiana’s state bird, but these flying rodents are all over the gulf region. And some of the Louisiana ones are brown but lots of them are white as toilet paper. That’s not very NBA. You have to go east to find the true urban pelicans-of-color: **MIAMI PELICANS** - **HEAT** Vikings intentionally swapped names of Greenland and Iceland in a brilliant real estate marketing ploy. It didn’t work out of course, but maybe it worked on just enough ‘right’ people. Toronto doesn’t need to fool all players into thinking Toronto is not literally located on the north pole. Just enough of them to fill a roster that is not an all-scrubs-team. Also Toronto actually does have really beautiful summers. All 6 weeks of them! **TORONTO HEAT** - **RAPTORS**. Dinosaurs have always been a major point of contention for all western religions. Their existence really spoil the plot of “THE GOD” S1E 1. When Mormons ended up settling in what is now modern day Utah, they ended up in a region with one of the richest fossil deposits in the world. Look to the ground and dinosaur bones everywhere!

But it was Chicago Daily Tribune who first ever coined the word Jazz back in 1915. Also, best Jazz I have personally seen was in Chicago.

I’ve owned 4 different homes in a short period of time. Lived in all 4 corners of the country and done several renovations/repairs, even a build from the ground up. Ive made mistakes and learned from them. Over time Ive made my own list of honest and hard working contractors while also becoming aware of the amount of lying, two-faced contractors out there. So this story starts in Houston, Texas. A few days ago, in my 1994 home, my AC seemed to not be working so great. Ive changed two AC systems in my last house (3 and 5 ton) and had a general idea of how things work, what components fail, etc. Long story short, my 2006 system is leaking and it was getting pretty hot on a Sunday so I called an HVAC company to come and fill some refrigerant so I could get through the weekend. My intention was to have my regular hvac guy come out on Monday and evaluate repairs. I already spent 3 hours in my attic evaluating all the components before calling a big box company. Long story short, their “technician” came out and had no clue how any of the ducts ran (I did), couldnt figure out the problem (very obvious from a pressure test), and basically started telling me I need an entire new system without really evaluating whats going on. The answer by the way, is a leaking coil- but I was already in the mood to change the system. The guy tried to sell me a garbage brand Lennox 4 ton system for $24,000 while claiming its on a special from $36,000 and I need to act on it while supplies last. I told him I couldnt afford that and I really just want him to add some 410a to my system which is what I said in my service call. He then started to offer financing options. The thing is- I paid around $7000 just 2 years ago for a 3 ton American standard and $12,000 for a 5 ton Trane- so I already knew a ball park estimate. He then started getting into how bad of a brand Trane and American standard are and tried to sell me again on their Lennox garbage. I told him Ill be more than glad to pay for some refrigerant but I am not getting a system from them. He eventually filled it, I paid him his dues, and today my regular hvac guy came out. Im getting an American Standard 5 ton, 14.3 seer for around $12,000 all in. Obviously the big box company is around because home owners who dont know much are fear- sold into overpriced garbage. Ive also heard of contractors in the north charging obscene prices for their systems ($20-$30 k for replacements). While this story revolves around HVAC, Ive dealt with similar issues in plumbing, electrical, etc. It pays to know about your home and to be weary of contractor tactics. Its a shame there isnt a whole lot of honesty amongst trades people these days- but it’s worth the effort to find the good ones out there."}

For someone with an illness that could kill me in my 20s, who would like the perfect bag for their next (and maybe final) trip? 👌🏻 Hey all, hope you're all well. As the title implies, I am quite unwell and may not have much longer on this earth. Hence asking this question, despite it being asked over and over, because I have **quite unique requirements**. **TLDR: Which duffel suits me best, for 1-2 week trips, out of the 40L Patagonia, 55L Patagonia, or 71L North Face (or smaller North Face), given that this may be my final trip, and given that money is tight due to medical treatments etc?** At the moment, I own several Evergoods backpacks and slings. I also own (or semi-own, shared with my partner) an old-style, bright red, plasticky-looking Patagonia Black Hole duffel in 55L (I hate the colour and look of it, only got it as it was like $100 USD off). Other than that, I just have a medium-size American Tourister suitcase. Anyway, long story short, I'd like to get a new duffel. Part of it is that I've always hated the shiny look of the Patagonia duffels - no longer an issue with this 2024 update. But it has annoyed me for years, our bright red Patagonia 😡 It would be used primarily for trips 1-2 weeks long, naturally sometimes just a weekend trip, pretty much always domestically. I'm someone who struggles to pack smartly and minimally - especially in winter. So that's something to consider, but I'm getting back into it, meaning the whole \"minimalist\" carrying thing. I would largely have the ability to wash my clothes on the go. It would need to fit: probably enough clothes for five days, including business shoes + a toiletries/dopp kit (using an Evergoods CAP2 for this) + a medicines kit (have a number of health issues, again, using a different CAP2 for this) + ideally my Birkenstocks (I wear Converses on my days off, business shoes for work naturally and nice dinners, and the Birkenstocks for little things like walking down the road to the local supermarket, or taking the laundry out to hang it up etc). But I can live without the Birkenstocks on trips, so it would be: wearing Converses with business shoes in the duffel. Naturally, laptop + power bank + most medicines (especially important for my Ritalin) + a book + cables + whatever else can go in my Evergoods 24L CPL. And then with my sling to take out each day to explore. So I am not sure whether to get the Patagonia or the North Face, in the 40 (Patagonia), 55L (Patagonia), or the North Face in S or M. Sadly, where I live, it is more or less impossible to see them in person before buying. I have the 55L Patagonia, as I said, and other than the colour/textile, the main things I don't like are: a) lack of internal organisation (not improved for the 2024 version I believe), and b) when not crammed full, it sags and lacks structure. I'm hoping this is a bag I can use for many years to come, and I'm just sick of having to use my suitcase all the time (just that it's big, chunky, obnoxious). For other types of travel I've got an Osprey backpack that I pair with my sling for exploring during the day. So yes, my questions are: 1. What size would be appropriate, given it will be largely for one to two week trips, with me not being great at packing smartly and minimally, with the options being 40L, 55L or 71L, but with the option of washing say once every 5-7 days?; and 2. Which brand/product is better - durability, cost, value, look, warranty etc? I will say - I love the \"look\" of the Patagonia, especially in the matte blue finish. Other than that, I'm open to jumping ship to the North Face, if needed. Final thing is the price - I can get the 40L Patagonia (new design) for $185 AUD, so \\~$120 USD, I can get the 55L Patagonia (new design) for around $200 AUD, so \\~$130 USD, and the North Face M for $175 AUD, so \\~$115 USD. The North Face is therefore around $100 AUD cheaper than normal, meaning, $100 AUD cheaper than th"}

While no single element of Red Dead Redemption 2 is revolutionary, due to its ambitious scope, it's greater than the sum of its parts. Few single-player experiences excel simultaneously at telling a deep and poignant story, whilst also providing the player with such a huge extent of freedom and possibility. The universe is exceedingly broad, varied, and beautiful, not to mention overflowing with interesting characters, wildlife, and things to do. The sense of polish and finer details really bring things together, along with the excellent musical score, fantastic voice acting and the title's intense and visceral cinematic qualities. Fans of the original Red Dead Redemption will be enamoured by the sequel. It doesn't just accentuate the West, but animates it on a new level, with a greater sense of life, community, and narrative. It's epic. -------------- **Daily Dot** - Joseph Knoop - [4.5 / 5 stars](https://www.dailydo"}

If not, you can **soft reset** a limited amount of times, which entails simply deleting and recreating your account. This generic hard reset guide applies to Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge: 1. Delete your account (if you're banned, you won't be able to, in which case skip this step) 2. If on a device, uninstall the app 3. Create a new email address 4. Get a new number (or [use a service that will sent you a verification text, usually for under $5](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;q=tinder+verification+number)) 5. Edit your photos in some way to make them not the same photo, e.g. adding a pixel somewhere, cropping, and/or strip EXIF info, save with different filename (*note: there is some evidence that the apps are using image hash comparisons, which means you need to use completely different photos*). 6. Use a different IP address than when you created your account (e.g. use your phone internet or go to a public WiFi hotspot — you can *probably* return to your original WiFi once the hard reset is successful) 7. Open your web browser or get a new device (cheap burner Androids are $30-40 on Swappa or eBay) * if you buy a new iPhone, you will need a new AppleID * if you plan to use your new phone on hotspot or wifi, you don't need a SIM card. 8. Create a new account with your new number and email address Other considerations: * Don't link old Instagram/Spotify etc. * Don't pay with the same card if buying premium services * Don't use a VPN. * Never do face verification unless you're forced to * You **don't** need to wait a certain period of time (like 90 days) if doing a hard reset * You can **never** log in to your new account from the device you got banned on, or you risk a ban ***\"Do I really have to do every step?\"*** or ***\"I know someone who didn't use a new device or a new IP address and they still got through!\"*** The way these apps likely detect banned users is by assigning each newly-created profile a risk score. The more you match the fingerprint of a banned user, the more likely you are to be banned. So yes, it's possible that someone can slip around a ban while not following all of this to the letter, but ideally you create a brand new fingerprint and don't have to rely on luck. ***\"I followed the Hard Reset Guide and it didn't work!\"*** Some users try the above steps and for whatever reason, it just doesn't work. We're not there alongside you making sure you did everything right, but even if you did, there's uncertainty around Match Group's detection algorithm. Hard resetting seems to have become much less reliable starting in early 2023. If a hard reset does not work and you truly believe you have been banned unfairly, there are three options: 1. Match Group have an arbitration process that can be kicked off by sending a letter to their legal department. See more in section 15 of the Terms of Service ([Hinge, for example](https://hinge.co/terms/)). 2.

As of early 2024, in some situations, Hinge and Tinder have [ban appeal processes](https://hingeapp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061998734-How-can-I-appeal-my-ban). **If the Hard Reset Guide worked for you, help others out by posting a success story below!**"}

Sales for the once-stodgy brand were up 39% in the first quarter with a refreshed lineup of compact SUVs including the Envision, Encore GX, and the Envista, its top-selling SUV for under $30,000. Then President Trump’s tariffs hit. Buick’s three most popular models are made outside the U.S. The Envista and Encore GX are both built in South Korea, while the Envision SUV is made in China. That means all three are now subject to stiff tariffs that could add thousands to sticker prices on dealer lots in the U.S. Buick’s South Korea-made models face a 27.5% tariff and the Envision out of China faces a steep 47.5% fee with a 25% auto tariff, a 20% China fentanyl tariff and a previously existing 2.5% auto tax, according to a Barclays analysis. It's bad news for Buick dealers, which have been thrilled by recent models by the brand that has for years struggled to shake off a stereotype that may no longer apply. Analysts believe higher prices could stall Buick’s momentum, and even threaten its survival. \"The latest wave of Buick vehicles is affordable, are good quality, are decent vehicles, and ruining that with a cost disadvantage could upset Buick as a going entity in the U.S.,\" said Sam Fiorani, vice president of research firm AutoForecast Solutions. Buick declined to comment for this story. RE-EVALUATING PORTFOLIOS Trump's tariffs are pushing auto executives to analyze their portfolios and evaluate if the costs are worth it in the long term to keep importing some foreign-made models. The tariffs, enacted earlier this month, have already led to some changes. GM moved to increase truck output at an Indiana plant and Stellantis, maker of Ram trucks and Jeeps, temporarily halted production at two plants in Mexico and in Canada. In a Tuesday, April 15 note, Barclays said it's assuming automakers \"will no longer sell vehicles that cannot be sold profitably,\" including vehicles imported from China and Korea as a result of auto tariffs. For GM specifically, Barclays expects the automaker will cease imports out of Korea and China of about 450,000 vehicles because of tariffs. Barclays is cutting its 2025 GM earnings before interest and taxes estimates by 40% based on lower volume and the gross tariff impact of about $9.5 billion. For its crosstown competitor Ford Motor, Barclays expects a 60% reduction with a gross tariff impact of about $7 billion. Ford ships its Lincoln Nautilus from China. Affordable vehicles like the Envista and Chevrolet Trax, both built in South Korea, stand to take the biggest hit from tariffs because automakers often build them outside the U.S. The impact on affordable vehicles is an industry-wide concern with the average transaction price of a new vehicle in the U.S. \"north of $48,000,\" according to research firm Cox Automotive, which expects tariffs will cause a 10% to 15% increase in prices of affected models, and an overall 5% jump in prices of vehicles not subject to the levies. STALLING THE NEW BUICK Buick's lineup has either been replaced or refreshed in the last 20 months leading to sales increases. The brand’s yearly sales in 2023 increased by 61% and by 10% in 2024, according to the company’s sales figures. The 2023 arrival of the Envista, a small SUV priced starting at $23,800, elevated the brand. New styling for the Envision, a compact SUV starting at $36,500, came last year, further amplifying it. “Envision is the bestseller right now,” said Jeff Laethem, GMC and Buick dealer in Detroit. “Once they put the Envista styling on it, that's when it took off.” Buick’s market share in the U.S. has jumped from 0.8% in 2022 to 1.1% in 2024 and 1.6% in the first quarter of 2025, according to data from Edmunds.com. Buick has “probably th"}

What you're reading is my third or fourth attempt at conveying this story, and while I can’t promise you’ll be on the edge of your seat, but I can promise both general fashion drama *and* sneaker drama, all for one ticket). I read every comment on every writeup I post. In doing this, I can’t help but notice a sort of trend amongst a few of them. Something along the lines of, *“I can’t imagine spending xyz amounts of money on shirts or shoes when the very basic essentials in my closet do me just as well.”* And you’re absolutely correct in saying this. I will happily argue my beloved sneakers and various streetwear brands are good, but I’d never call them *better*. But what if I told you, just a handful of years ago, those very basic essentials that do you just as well *were* fashion? As in, those Mall Brands and ubiquitous wardrobe pieces we so often take for granted were co-opted by the fashion-fervent such that decades-old outlet sneakers were voted the best of the year and rich, beautiful internet models cosplayed as Joe Sixpack on some of the biggest platforms on the internet, to the extent that both sides of the fashion coin joined hands in irritated unison? That’s a loaded question. Let me crush it down to something simpler: What the hell is (was) Normcore? # Fashion Styles: A crash course Styles, in the sense of personal fashion, are so numerous and technical at this point that the very outfit you’re wearing right now could inadvertently be considered one you’ve never heard of. The internet has only increased the speed at which these movements take wing. While throwing the words Fashion and Style and Trend in the same sentence may evoke embarrassing memories of teen magazines, the conceit of theming one’s wardrobe to one’s personal ethos is understandable and universal. Your clothes aren’t just what you own, they’re reflections of who you are (remember this). To that end, style begets community, identity, self-discovery, and monthly bank statements you try your best not to look at as you stuff it under a mountain of papers. Or maybe your style isn’t that deep, doesn’t “reflect who you are,” and the satisfaction you get out of fit pics is uncomplicated, aesthetic pleasure. I’d say the most popular style of the modern era would have to be [Streetwear](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/32/8c/fb/328cfbe520f91e8dc1d9b1446a1468cb.jpg), which combines basically every counter-culture movement around the world into a unified voice that either [whispers](https://i.pinimg.com/236x/23/42/30/234230abd91c15c473ced76885172380.jpg) or [screams](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5bb7fc06ab1a62666096952b/1546718370928-Z3CB5ZKSBW98CCTNHZRH/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kGeNtXjnSVE0FC98ofHjoQx7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UVURxIstYj4VcQ3u4G8psS8p19-2HRX2fy4mVTF2-S9JlPRhrjbf-ufqwsSWgrw9rg/asspizza-blog16-1.jpg?format=1500w) depending on the taste of its wearer.

This question crossed my mind recently and I started doing some googling and I was surprised to learn that some of my favorite \"core\" brands are actually owned by giant investment firms or corporations. In general, as a lover of this sport, I want to support the smaller, rider owned and operated brands with my dollar when it comes time to buy new gear. Take Volcom for example. Volcom is a brand I always considered \"core\" and cool with a rad team, but they're actually owned by Authentic Brands, which [now owns the Boardriders](https://thedaily.outdoorretailer.com/news/brands-and-retailers/authentic-brands-closes-boardriders-acquisition/#:~:text=The%20New%20York%2Dbased%20brand,to%20a%20licensing%20operating%20model) group (Quicksilver, Roxy, DC, Billabong, plus a few others). This now puts Volcom and Quicksilver next to brands like David Beckham, Frye, Forever 21, Izod, Nautica, and Spyder. [Link to Authentic Brands' portfolio](https://corporate.authentic.com/brands) Another example, Mervin. I always thought of Lib and Gnu as rad, independent, rider owned brands but no. Apparently (according to [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mervin_Manufacturing#:~:text=Mervin%20was%20purchased%20by%20Quiksilver,was%20purchased%20by%20Altamont%20Capital)) they were bought by Quicksilver in the late 90s, and by Altamont Capital in 2014. Colored me surprised. I found this pretty funny, especially after T Ricky's That's it That's All part where the Lib logo is peeing on a Burton logo, when Burton is actually still privately owned. So final example is Burton, which I know is still privately owned. Say what you will about them being \"core\" or not, but I think the fact they've chosen to stay private is rad and a positive for our industry. I personally think they have deservedly lost a lot of respect from the community with various moves like buying up brands to drop them later, *cough* *Forum* *cough,* but they do continue to invest in putting out solid products and supporting rad riders. Anyways, I'm just wondering if anyone has a solid list of who is still privately (and ideally rider) owned in the snowboard industry. I managed to find a 12 yr old [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/snowboarding/comments/m4di1/snowboarding_who_owns_who_jpg/) that linked to a cool [info graphic](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Q5GWc46SESE/S118yx6JbgI/AAAAAAAAB3w/4qn2AchkQzg/s1600-h/Brand-Map.jpg) and I would love to see a current version of this.

I'd always been mildly curious about it. A more liberal-leaning culture than some of its Arab peers, only a short hop from Europe, with some appealing autumn weather. I'd visited North Africa for a road trip through Southern Morocco about ten years ago so had a vague idea of what to expect. I enjoyed that experience as a holiday but it never struck me as somewhere I'd opt to work from. I thought I'd challenge these assumptions with a few short city visits in the region, with Tunis the first stop. I usually book a month in places but I had sufficient reservations about Tunis that 10 nights felt like a safe amount to test the waters. There's a few fundamental reasons why I won't go back and likely explain why it's never developed into a more popular remote work destination. I don’t like tearing into a destination, especially one which is in unquestionably part of the developing world. I can already foresee the comments of “*What did you expect?!*”. I couldn’t find a glut of information prior to the trip so I’ll endeavour to be as detailed as possible, which may be useful if you’re eyeing it up as somewhere to visit. # Main negatives: **The trash.** I am no eco-warrior. I am unperturbed by most displays of litter and waste. But what I saw across Tunis genuinely shocked me. Trash is *everywhere*. This is not just a couple of crisp packets on the street. Industrial-scale fly-tipping of residential and commercial waste is rampant. The issue actually gets worse as you leave the city centre and more open spaces emerge. This isn't a problem confined to certain neighbourhoods but a pervasive part of even the areas deemed to be more upmarket such as Le Marsa and Sidi Bou Said. The issue apparently stems from a lack of government funding for proper waste disposal, but it feels like it has resulted in a wider societal acceptance of using any open space as a dumping ground. Residential areas, parks and transit stations all become fair game. I can't recall seeing anything like it, rivalled only by my experience in India 15 years ago. Areas which have potential to be scenic outdoor spots like Belvedere Park, just north of the downtown, or the coastline near Corniche Lac 2, end up resembling waste disposal facilities. **The structure of the city.** A lot of guidance for conventional tourists visiting Tunis will suggest staying in one of the coastal districts outside of the downtown itself. I followed this and opted for the area of Sidi Bou Said. The downtown was almost exactly as I envisaged. You've got the ancient Medina, one quite nicely landscaped main boulevard, and then streets peeling off it in various states of decay. For comparison, no area in the downtown really felt like it gets close to what you may expect from an urban setting in Europe. The streets are gritty, the building stock is generally tired and distressed. It has a certain charm to it. I visited three times during my stint and particularly enjoyed bouncing around small smoke-filled sports bars watching the afternoon football with a local beer. There's even a surprisingly good rooftop bar which feels like it could come straight out of East London. But I'm confident that for most people it's not an urban environment you'd be too excited about basing yourself in for an entire month. The guidance to be in the coastal areas does make sense. By car they are around a 20km trip. The main issue I found is that La Marsa just isn't that great as somewhere to work from. It's billed as more of an upmarket, beachside town, and whilst it might be by local or national standards, it didn't feel that significantly different. There is a train line connecting it to the centre, passing through Sidi Bou Said and Carthage but I saw no evidence of the train running throughout my stay. On the first day I attempted to get a ticket and a man swiftly redirected me to the bus station. I never"}

Her case, which is classified as a stranger abduction, is still unsolved. Teekah is described as a Multiracial female with black hair, brown eyes. Teekah is of African-American, Caucasian and Native American descent. Her mother is Caucasian and Chippewa while her father is African American. She has a large birthmark on her left buttock and red natural highlights in her hair. She has patches of light discoloration on her face and the left side of her buttocks as the result of eczema. Teekah has facial dimples, and pierced ears. Some reports say that Teekah had a silver streak on the right front section of her hair. It is unclear if this was a dyed section or a natural section of gray hair, although I would assume it was natural. She was wearing a green Tweety Bird sweatshirt or t-shirt, white sweatpants and black and white Air Jordan sneakers, with her hair pulled into ponytails. She was carrying a clear purse with a fish design, containing Starburst candies. Teekah had eczema and also suffered from asthma at the time she went missing. She used an inhaler. Teekah is described as a shy mama’s girl who loved Pooh bear and eating starburst candy. It is believed that Teekah was abducted by a white male in his 30s. He had a large nose, a pockmarked face, and shoulder length wavy or curly brown hair. He was wearing a blue checkered flannel shirt and blue jeans and drove a dark colored late 80s or early 90s model Pontiac Grand Am.

Maintenance starts buzzing around on their golf carts, the custodial cast members bring out the large hoses to wash down every inch of the streets we all walk on, and the construction crews are allowed past the security perimeter gates to come in and do whatever needs to be done. That's where my story begins. I've worked construction most of my life. When work dried up up North, I moved to Florida where some of my family had moved over ten years ago. Naturally, I needed to find a job. I wound up applying for and getting hired by a construction company that shall remain nameless that literally did almost all of the construction needs for \"The Coorporate Mouse\". I spent five or six overnights a week at various locations at WDW with coworkers (we weren't employed by Disney hence we were not \"Cast Members\") doing whatever our foreman told us what needed to be done. Sweet gig actually, even though it was very hard work at times. Just think...how many people can truly say the get to ride around Magic Kingdom, Animal Kingdom, etc in the dead of night in trucks, golf carts, what have you while the park is just about empty except for a skeleton crew? For about the first six months, I kind of kept to myself except for talking with the crew of the company that I worked for. Then I began noticing how chummy many of the Disney overnight crew was with our staff. Custodians, when working in the same areas as us would come and talk to the boys as well as the overnight security cast members. I began to slowly get to know many of these folks as well. They, for the most part, were really nice. I got to know many of the night security staff (by face at least) at all four parks as well as the resorts. If you didn't know, WDW opened in 1971. It was actually not too uncommon to come across someone who had been a \"lifer\" with Disney or knew someone who was. Forty plus years working for the Mouse...God bless 'em. Even my foreman, who although did not work directly for WDW, was one of these. Boy...did they have some stories to tell to pass the time. As I adjusted more to the job, I began to get more comfortable with the surroundings. The cast members grew more social towards me, and I was able to make my way through the parks without getting lost too. Let me tell you, that is not an easy feat when you first start out working there. Especially at night. Although it's not PITCH black, there is very minimal lighting except where we put our floodlights up to do work. Security is only using flashlights or the headlight of their carts to light their ways, and store lights are only on if someone is working in them. Quite eerie and yet cool at the same time. It's like a totally different place than during operating hours. As a matter of fact, one time when I decided to visit the park as a guest, I couldn't find a ride that I wanted to go on because it looked so different during the day with all the colors, people, sounds, and music. One year of working at the place full time and I had to swallow my stupid pride and go get a map. Ha ha...pathetic. Anyway, as I started conversing more and more with the Cast Members, some of the security staff and I found out that we had a mutual intrest in the paranormal (of course that would come up in coversation eventually w"}

After dinner on a recent school night, 16-year-old Ace sat in a dining room chair while their mom, Mara, brushed and braided their hair. It’s a familiar ritual – something they do every time Ace performs with their high school dance team. “You do all the mom things,” Ace said. “I do all the mom things,” Mara agreed. Ace loves being on the dance team. It’s an important part of who they are. But, this school year, another important part of their identity is being quashed. “When everyone knows that you go by a different name, and no one can call you that, you get a lot of looks,” Ace said. Ace is nonbinary, and everyone they know has called them by their chosen, gender-neutral name, since they were 9. “I was a very, like, pretty pink princess little child, but I don't think I ever really wanted to be a girl,” Ace said. “It didn't fit.” Ace’s preference is for their pronouns to be switched between she and they, but they said they’re used to being called she. “I live in Texas, so I don't exactly expect that much,” Ace said. But, this year, their teachers have been told they can no longer call Ace by their chosen name. And that’s really getting under their skin. Names and pronouns In August, Ace’s school district, North East Independent School District in San Antonio, told employees that because of Senate Bill 12, they can only call students by names and pronouns that match the sex listed on their birth certificate. For Ace, that means some teachers avoid calling them anything at all. “They'll be like, ‘It's either your last name or I just don't call on you.’ Or, like, ‘If I need you, I'll point at you.’ So, in certain classes, I'm just on high alert, because I don't know what the teacher will be feeling that day,” Ace said. “It’s really dehumanizing.” North East ISD Superintendent Sean Maika said the district is just trying to follow the law. “These aren't things that we're saying. We're following the law,” Maika said. “Oftentimes I've referred to it as the perfect crime, because a law has been passed and it looks like our fingerprints are all over it, but we're just following the law.” Maika said the district issued guidance on pronouns and names in order to protect their staff. Another new law makes it easier for parents to sue teachers and librarians. “The parent could sue them. … And then sanction their certification, and all sorts of things. So, there's some pretty big consequences to that,” Maika said. North East is basing its guidance on names on a section of SB 12 that bans school employees from assisting with social transitioning. But Ace’s mom, Mara, said that’s not what teachers would be doing if they called Ace by their name. “The truth of the matter is, I don't think of my child as transitioning,” Mara said. “Their identity is established.” As Mara spoke, Ace struck a pose, with their hands framing their face, as if to say “Ta-da.” “Mom, I’m not a girl,” Ace joked, as if it were brand new information. Parents' rights Supporters of SB 12 say it gives parents more rights. In a statement earlier this year, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said the law \"reasserts parents as the primary decision-makers in their child’s public school education by eliminating discriminatory Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion ideology in public schools.” But Mara said that doesn’t match her experience. “This isn't about parent rights, because nobody asked me, and I'm the parent,” Mara said. “And it's not about making it easier for teachers, because the teachers are apologizing to the students.” North East says their staff can’t call Ace by their chosen name even with Mara’s permission. Attorney Brian Klosterboer with the ACLU of Texas questions that position. “That is nowhere to be seen in the law itself, but because the socia"}

Anyway…on to the post lol I’m coming from a 65” TCL 4 series 4k UHD HDR LED tv. This may be part of why I’m so thrilled, as it’s admittedly not a great TV. That said, it died (one of the backlight LEDs burned out). I had a 55” variant of it in storage and used that as a “stop gap” while I researched…and waited (about 1.5 months). I ended up getting the 65” QD-OLED S90D for $958 brand new after seeing this post back on the 31st of August: (can’t post the actual link even though it’s just to the buildapcpartsales subreddit, was removed as spam the first time). Long story short, was a link to an authorized retailer on eBay that was running a sale on them brand new, and simultaneously eBay was offering a 20% coupon separately for anything on eBay). so I got the 1 year warranty through the manufacturer and bought it with a credit card I keep paid off and use exclusively for electronics purchases (adds an additional five years to the manufacturers warranty). My use cases are movies/TV from an entirely self curated Plex library, nearly all which is HDR/HDR10/HDR10+, along with some sports consumed via an HD IPTV provider (and my HDhomerun for local news sports). All of the above are consumed exclusively through the Plex interface. Reason for the almost exclusively HDR variant content is the TV I’m coming from also didn’t support Dolby vision but did support HDR. What’s funny now that I’m watching this new TV, Id swear the old TV didn’t even support HDR. It’s a laughable difference on the new set. All of the above said…the picture is absolutely ridiculous. I followed rtings.com setup for picture settings and when my wife came home and I “demo’d” it for her, she was legit slack jawed. It’s just truly gorgeous. The room I have it in is the living room, 10’ or so from the sitting area. Pretty bright room, windows directly behind where you sit so the TV faces them. They’re north facing windows so the sun is never directly shining through them however. That said, with the TCL roku TV we’d have to keep the blinds and curtains closed entirely or you really couldn’t see the picture. This TV, literally can’t even notice the windows, even with the blinds and curtains fully open in the middle of the day (unless it’s an all or mostly black scene). The colors, the vibrancy, even the “upscaler” for my local news is astounding. I’m just really super happy with it and figured I’d share. If it dies however, I promise I’ll come back and share with everyone hahaha."}

I have been wanting to do this work for years, so my dream has come true. --Why did you choose the Azuchi-Momoyama period as the setting for this work? **KARL**: I chose it because it is a very rich period in history. It was a time of war and political maneuvering, a time of change from rural to urban areas, and also the birth of art. I also chose it because it was the start of the unification of Japan. It was a pivotal moment for Japan. Together, these elements provided an excellent canvas on which to tell the story. --What kind of image do you have of the Azuchi-Momoyama period? **KARL**: This was a time when the feudal lords of the warring states were fighting for power in the name of unifying the country, but it was also a struggle for control of trade. Portuguese missionaries and merchants came to Japan together. The Portuguese missionaries and merchants came to Japan together, and people who wanted a beautiful country and peace. This is the kind of image we have, but I think there was a mixture of various cultures and people's thoughts. And of course, there were the warring feudal lords. These are great canvases for the story. --What do you think should be inherited from \"Assassin's Creed\" and what are the unique aspects of this game? **KARL**: When people think of \"Assassin's Creed,\" they think of stealth, but shinobi fantasy is not only a perfect fit for an \"Assassin's Creed\" game, it also fits the DNA of the \"Assassin\" brand. What we wanted to do with \"Assassin's Creed Shadows\" was to push stealth even further. We started this effort with the previous game, \"Assassin's Creed Mirage,\" but we wanted to take it further with new features. Systems such as light and shadow, grappling ropes, prone, and a variety of tools available in the game provide a new experience. The gameplay is also enriched by two characters, Naoe, a shinobi, and Yasuke, a samurai. Players will explore and discover Japan through the eyes of Naoe, a local, and one non-Japanese outsider. The game is more dynamic than ever before, pushing the limits of technology and offering an experience exclusive to current-gen consoles. --The \"Assassin's Creed: Valhalla,\" released in 2020, is based on the theme of \"Vikings\" and has been a huge sales success. As a Japanese, I feel that from a global perspective, the Japanese \"shinobi\" theme is even more niche, but what is your current response? **KARL**: I would like to talk about how it compares to \"Viking\" fantasy. Both shinobi and samurai are exciting and celebrated as fantasy with power, and are widely discussed in pop culture, and we are very much inspired by them. Shinobi were on our radar from the beginning because we thought they fit well with the \"Assassins\" brand, but we felt that incorporating a powerful samurai would create two different gameplay experiences and give us the opportunity to tell the story from two different perspectives. We feel that this is a powerful motif that can compete with the \"Viking\" motif. --How did you like the setting of Japan as a subject matter for the latest model? **KARL**: I think it was perfect. For example, the \"Global Illumination\" technology allowed us to explore the response of light and shadow. Some consoles are still called \"Baked GI\", but by using dynamic lighting and the power of the new hardware, we were able to explore the creativity. We are now able to express not only light and shadow, but also "}

A lot of the drama that springs up here is very dense and emotion-driven, as well as being incomprehensible to most outsiders. I'm gonna try my best to keep the tangents and insider wrestling jargon to a minimum here, so feel free to comment about any parts you don't understand. I'm also recalling a ton of this from memory, so bear with me. **A Quick Glossary:** WWE - World Wrestling Entertainment, formerly the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). For the purposes of this post I may refer to WWE/WWF interchangeably. Kayfabe - wrestling lingo for \"in universe\", the overall masquerade that dictates all the onscreen action/drama is \"real\" and the wrestlers are the characters they're playing. Babyface - the \"good guy\" or hero in a story. Also called a \"Face\" for short. Heel - the \"bad guy\" or villain. Conventional wisdom in the industry often dictates that heels are more interesting characters than faces. Because wrestling. Heel turn - a good guy turns evil and becomes a heel. Despite the above conventional wisdom, this is *not* always a good thing. Face turn - a bad guy turns good and becomes a babyface. Smark - shorthand for a hardcore wrestling fan, for the purposes of this post. A portmanteau of \"smart mark\", which has elaborate carny roots I won't go into here. #Introduction The central conceit of professional wrestling is guys doing a mostly-convincing performance of beating each other up, often against the backdrop of a wider feud or narrative spanning months or even years at a time. Think MMA, but less boring and with soap opera dramatics. And like any other soap opera, wrestling had its designated heroes (babyfaces) and villains (heels). Let's get one thing out of the way: WWE is the biggest wrestling company in the world, and you'll be hard-pressed to find a wrestling fan who hasn't heard of some version of it. WWE is also synonymous with wrestling itself to most (but not all) lay people across the world. WWE's biggest storylines play out on one of two weekly TV programs: Monday Night Raw, and Smackdown Live. (WWE's third major weekly show, NXT, is a whole other messy story that merits an entire post of its own.) WWE also has monthly pay-per-view shows - think Wrestlemania or the Royal Rumble - which often serve as the \"climax\" to a given short- or long-term feud. There are generally three types of viewer attitudes towards the overall brand: * Type 1: casual fans (\"marks\") who believe **WWE is the center of the wrestling universe**; * Type 2: more \"involved\" hardcore fans (\"smarks\") who know that **WWE is just one wrestling company out of many**, each with its own style and ethos. However, due to the nature of wrestling and the [controversial history](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_WWE) of how WWE became the industry leader in the first place, there is significant overlap between Type 2 and * Type 3: **WWE is evil**, in the classic \"Big Bad Monopolistic Multimillion-Dollar Corporation\" sense that embodied everything wrong with capitalism. So... what does all of this have to do with Roman Reigns? #The WWE Ideal There are certain \"fan myths\" that have been built around wrestling over the years, WWE in particular. Some are more true than others. A common one is that WWE has terrible storylines, and that they're incompetent at writing babyfaces. One of the most pervasive myths (of many) however revolves around Vince McMahon, WWE's longtime CEO (and occasional onscreen villain) who also had the final say in most canonical feuds and storylines behind the scenes. According to most smarks, Vince McMahon is a size queen. Which is to say he favors \"larger than life\" wrestlers built like bodybuilders with a bombastic personality to match. Think Hulk Hogan or The Rock or John Cena: they're the epitome of Vince's d"}

Vice President Kamala Harris spent a remarkable $1.5 billion in her hyper-compressed 15-week presidential campaign. But in the days since losing to President-elect Donald J. Trump, her operation has faced questions internally and externally over where exactly all that cash went. Despite her significant financial advantage, Ms. Harris became the first Democratic presidential candidate to lose the national popular vote in two decades, ceding every battleground state to Mr. Trump. Her cash-rich campaign spared no expense as it hunted for voters — paying for an avalanche of advertising, social-media influencers, a for-hire door-knocking operation, thousands of staff, pricey rallies, a splashy Oprah town hall, celebrity concerts and even drone shows. It was a spree that averaged roughly $100 million per week. The frenzied spending has led to second-guessing among some Democrats, including whether investing in celebrity-fueled events with stars such as Lady Gaga and Beyoncé was more ostentatious than effective. Since her loss, the Harris operation has pressed supporters for more cash with desperate-sounding solicitations, stirring fears about post-election debts. “Is there anything we can say?” came one email asking for cash last Monday. The biggest expense during the race was advertising. Between July 21 and Oct. 16, financial records show that the Harris campaign spent $494 million on producing and buying media, a category that includes both television and digital ads. The total sum through the election is said to be closer to $600 million. Yet starting in October, her campaign was actually narrowly outspent on broadcast television by Mr. Trump, according to data from the ad-tracking service AdImpact. The ads were just one piece of a campaign that had enough cash to spend on seemingly everything. There was $2.5 million directed toward three digital agencies that work with online influencers, records show. The campaign spent around $900,000 to book advertising on the exterior of the Sphere venue in Las Vegas in the last week of the race, two officials said. There were drone shows in the sky before the debate in Philadelphia in September and at a Pittsburgh Steelers game in October. In a note on Friday to Ms. Harris’s top fund-raisers, Chris Korge, the Democratic National Committee’s finance chair, said that losing all seven battleground states had “shocked us all.” “I will absolutely push for an introspective study and analysis of the campaign, its structure, its messaging, all communication platforms and budgeting,” Mr. Korge wrote. Given the magnitude of Ms. Harris’s loss, more of the focus so far has been on the Democratic brand and message rather than the mechanics of her operation. Ms. Harris inherited a campaign based in inconvenient Wilmington, Del., that was built for President Biden, and she had limited time to refashion it to better suit her strengths. Ms. Harris added some senior advisers but mostly kept the Biden team in place, including Jennifer O’Malley Dillon, the powerful campaign chair who oversaw the finances and virtually every major move. Jennifer O’Malley Dillon was part of the Biden team that stayed on after Ms. Harris rose to the top of the Democratic ticket. As campaign chair, she oversaw the finances and virtually every major move.Erin Schaff/The New York Times The campaign’s spending decisions were documented in Federal Election Commission records and interviews with 15 Harris campaign officials and close allies, most of whom insisted on anonymity to discuss internal finances and dynamics candidly.

I had a lot of fun looking back on when I used to play this game competitively (although I've been inactive since about 2016). I'm sure someone from the competitive TF2 scene will eventually see this post -- if there's anything I get incorrect, please let me know. --- #**An introduction to competitive Team Fortress 2** Team Fortress 2 (TF2) is a multiplayer first-person shooter game that was released in 2007 by Valve -- a company also famous for games like Half-Life, Counter-Strike, and Portal. The game has nine different and distinct “classes” -- basically characters which do different things. The Scout is a fast-moving glass cannon that carries a shotgun, Soldier walks slowly but carries a rocket launcher which can allow him to move super quickly… so on and so forth. You don’t need to have an encyclopedic knowledge of all the classes to understand the story, so I’ll spare you the details. Though Team Fortress 2 was a massive success for casual players, it had a pretty small competitive community. Even at its peak back in 2010 or so, it was still niche. Big sponsors eventually started exiting the scene, as did many players. A decent portion of top-level players still kept grinding the game out of passion, but even that eventually died down as many players moved on. The community was akin to a small town: everyone knew everyone -- this was especially true around the time of this story (2016). To this day, the competitive TF2 scene still remains, small as it is. There's quite a bit of depth to the metagame of competitive TF2, but, for the sake of simplicity, I’ll only mention the important things. The main competitive mode played in Team Fortress 2 is a six versus six format and is primarily composed four of the nine classes -- two Scouts, two Soldiers, a Demoman, and a Medic. The community pretty quickly reached the conclusion that the game is most fun when played like this. The other five classes are still played from time to time, but, again, that’s not exactly important to the drama. If you’re interested in the history of competitive TF2, I recommend checking out this super neat presentation [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLRhmad9Jq4) that was done by a former high-level player back in 2015. It goes pretty in-depth. Because only four classes are used regularly, most players generally specialize on one class in order to hone their skills. For instance, you probably won’t see the player Kaidus on anything except Demoman, you probably won’t see Clockwork on anything except Scout, etc. However, there is one notable exception: a player named b4nny. --- #**Who is b4nny?** b4nny, real name Grant Vincent, is one of the few “old-guard” players who still actively competed in TF2 during the time of this story. He started playing on an amateur team as Demoman in mid-2009 but quickly rose to the highest level of play. After only about a year and a half of competing, b4nny won his first championship in late 2010 against the best in North America. And he would continue his winning ways. From 2010 to 2016, b4nny would finish first place in **28** different events, including 2 world championships and 8 regional championships. One thing that’s also unique to b4nny is that he has won top events on three of the four main competitive classes at the highest level -- Scout, Soldier, and Demoman. No other player, to my knowledge, has ever accomplished this. In the earlier days of his career, not too much wasn’t known about b4nny. Most people just knew him as this quiet guy who had long hair and was insane at playing Demoman. These qualities gave b4nny the nickname [“Pipe Jesus”](https://i.imgur.com/DyW78g5.png) by the community -- with “pipes” referring to the grenades that the Demoman used. He also sat in a [pretty weird position](https://i.imgur.com/cATG"}

And also that there's a hate boner against states that question it like Kerala and TN? As I'm a Keralite, I'll list some issues that I've noted: **Paddy procurement dues that the union govt has to give the state, going as far as back from 2019 were paid(that too not fully) recently, only in 2024.** https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/centre-releases-paddy-procurement-dues-to-state/article67991753.ece https://malayalam.oneindia.com/news/kerala/centers-frauds-in-paddy-procurement-exposed-minister-mb-rajesh-455125.html (article in Malayalam. Google Translate seems to be facing cloudflare screening) Only half of the due amount has been given to the state according to the article. Another issue with the delayed fund is that the state has to shoulder the burden and the interest. The due is from 2019, that's 5 years of interest on the money used for that. Does the union govt provide interest on the due? If not, that's a loss that has to be borne by the state. Has the centre provided the other half yet? **Union govt fund share for NHM's have not been disbursed**: https://www.onmanorama.com/content/mm/en/kerala/top-news/2024/02/21/nhm-staff-on-warpath-kerala-healthcare-sector-in-crisis.amp.html I think this was recently mediated.

Black Ops 6 will launch with two brand-new Round-Based Zombie maps – Terminus and Liberty Falls – and a continuation of the intriguing and terrifying Dark Aether narrative that was started in Black Ops Cold War. Hordes of the undead are set to rampage through these brand-new locations, each offering countless hours of fast-paced action where power-ups are plentiful, but you’re never more than a few seconds away from being overwhelmed and devoured! For newcomers, Zombies is Treyarch’s unique take on a cooperative player experience where you face off against vast mobs of zombified creatures, with the bulk being the recently deceased, now animated due to strange, eldritch forces. Expect every location you visit to be packed with powerful weapons, new and returning power-ups, a pantheon of revolting entities to face, and a host of secrets and easter eggs to discover. Remember too, that many of the previously revealed innovations in movement, visual fidelity, audio, and weapons will all be coming to Zombies as well. That’s not including the many additional Zombies-specific features, both new and returning. Expect more information to come in the following weeks.

The woman entered my office uninvited. Maggie was sick at home or she would have sent her on her way. But then again, I got the feeling even Maggie couldn’t have refused this woman. She had a look of determination in her icy-blue eyes. Her short, ash-blonde hair was swept up to the side stylishly, and she carried an oversized bag with her. Immediately, I recognized what she was. I’d seen enough of her kind in my time. A pharmaceutical rep. “Doctor Balm,” she said, reaching out her hand. I took it and gave it a polite shake. “I’m Lisa from Rendexx Pharmaceuticals. We’ve been trying to reach you by telephone but never quite managed to connect.” Probably because my secretary has been doing her job, I thought to myself. She always screened those sorts of calls. I had no interest in being a shill for a drug company. “My apologies,” I said. “What can I do for you?” She set her large black bag on the reception counter next to where we were standing and began to pull out sample packets and brochures. The phone began to ring loudly at the desk. I wanted to answer it but the woman had already begun her pitch. “Well, that’s just it, Doctor Balm. It’s not about what you can do for us, but what we can do for your patients.” Here we go, I thought. She opened up a brochure and began to show me details from inside its glossy pages, speaking persuasively enough that I listened instead of immediately sending her on her way, as I usually did. She was an extremely good saleswoman. “Our newest drug, Smilatrex, has just been accepted for approval by the FDA. It’s an absolute game-changer. Effective for depression, anxiety, even thoughts of self harm can be allayed by its formula. This is the next generation we’re talking about. This drug, by itself, is going to completely replace SSRIs and benzos in the next few years. All the benefits without the harmful side effects and dependencies. Not only that, but instead of taking months to begin working, as is the case with most SSRIs, Smilatrex begins its effects almost immediately.” “Those are some very bold claims.” “So, you can see why we’ve been trying so hard to reach you, to talk to you about it,” she said with an undeterred smile. I picked up one of the sample boxes and examined it. The packaging looked like any other drug - a pale purple colour with yellow butterflies all over it - the company’s brand name stamped upon it in bold letters. “Rendexx Pharmaceuticals? How come I’ve never heard of you guys?” “We’re a German company. New to North America. But we’re going to make a big splash in the western markets. I’d tell you to start investing now but I’m sure you don’t play the stock market.” “No, I don’t. And I don’t usually speak to pharmaceutical reps either, if I'm being entirely honest. But if even half your claims are true....\" \"They're all true,\" she replied, her teeth fixed firmly in that unstoppable grin. \"Leave the sample packets. I'll do some research and think about it. How’s that?” She stuck out her hand for another shake and I took it reluctantly. “That’s all I can ask for, Doctor. I won’t take up anymore of your time, I’m sure you’re very busy.” Packing up her bag, she thanked me and left, the broad smile still plastered on her face. It was disarming, and I couldn’t help but smile back at her as she walked out, saying goodbye. I vowed to do some research on my own before giving out the sample packages to anyone, so that night I took a box home with a brochure and decided I would do a few hours of reading, trying to find out what exactly the benefits and side effects of Smilatrex would be. Don’t ask what got into my head. Why I ended up taking the pills, especially when I didn’t even know the first thing about the company or the product. I wouldn't say I'm depressed, per say. But I've slipped into a bit of a rut since my father died a couple years back. Every day feels the same. The old pleasures of life don't bring the same enjoyme"}

Homebrew and rule of cool apply. &amp;#x200B; Need to give some background info so: &amp;#x200B; Campaign mainly revolves around a set island where the south is infested with undead due to the returning of a necromancer who was killed 100 years ago. Group gets hired to take care of the problem. Session 0 and 1 are combined so it doesn't take long before the group is gathered at the shores of the mainland, ready to take off to said island. They aren't the only group that is being hired for the purpose of fending of the undead. Together with 3 other groups of 5 they are waiting for the galleon to arrive at the docks. Once the galleon does arrive in the distance there is a figure standing at the bow of it, a large figure. Once the galleon comes closer they can identify the figure as a large elf (7'2), the galleon slows down and comes to a stop at the docks where the male elf flicks his long golden hair, splattering his salt induces locks around, back flipping off of the bow to perform a gracious - Olympics landing. \\---- 'I'm L'Ovéale, and i am.. worth it.' (Pronounced as - Loo, vee, jaal -) \\------ Obviously the the hair flicking and the brand L'Oréal comes to mind to the players who scoff it off. They share drinks with the elf and realize he's a horrible drunk - summoning giant mugs of beer for everyone. But they do become very good friends in a short amount of time. The group then goes through a few different stages of the campaign. &amp;#x200B; \\- The galleon gets attacked by a Kraken, L'Ovéale jumps off the boat to face the kraken while commanding the groups to flee - the island is in sight so it should be swimmable. The group does get off the boat and attempts to swim to shore, they roll : 4, 6, 5, 8 and 3. They do make it, allthough deep in undead territory, without a glimpse of the other groups. \\- Backtracking through enemy territory they manage to reach the border (Big river dividing the north and south, there's only 1 bridge). Big fight breaks out between undead and living at the border bridge. Bridge eventually gets blown up. \\- They arrive at the city they were supposed to arrive with the galleon - is a slavers city. Long story short - part of the city gets blown up and is evacuated. &amp;#x200B; Now at this point we are at least 10 sessions in and L'Ovéale is something that keeps coming up. Every week. They haven't seen him, heard from him, but they check every inn or bar to check if he might be there. The last they know is him fighting off the Kraken and the nearby fisher's town serving a whole lot of giant sushi. As it is my first time DM'ing i'm quite proud - L'Ovéale is my very first NPC. &amp;#x200B; One week one of the campaign members isn't able to play, so i decided to host a one-shot canon story, inviting another friend to fill up the gap to 5 people. The players get pre-made characters by me. Dividing the character sheets went with a simple rule. I will call out the name of the character and his/her class, then someone can say 'Aye' if they want it. If no-one wants it, i roll for it to be randomly chosen. Calling out the first 2 names, unrecognizable names for the group but they still get chosen. The second 2 names are recognizable NPC's from the main campaign. Takes some time, but eventually they do get chosen. The last player wanted to wait out as long as he could - definitely digging for gold here. He receives the character sheet - named L'Ovéale - An elf male fighter. Players are totally stoked i put him in the one shot as we soon begin. Running a version of 'Igor's challenge' it does not take very long before some of the group is disqualified. Eventually the player who's playing as L'Ovéale happens upon the perfect challenge. A c"}

Beginning in September I’ve decided to live indefinitely out of a 32L backpack while traveling the globe. I’m a decently experienced traveler, have lived abroad, and got to do the digital nomad thing for a time - all this to say that I’m fairly confident going into this trip. My last lengthy one bag stint featured the Matador SEG30 (discontinued, but I still have mine and love it dearly) was in 2022; I visited 11 countries in around 6 months, working all the while. I actually cataloged some of my adventures on this account, including my original packing list! Fun memories to dig up and very interesting to compare my packing list now. This time around I’ll be doing some more adventurous travel and leaving behind my DN-friendly work setup. I’ve upgraded a lot of my gear, but there are still some proven winners from my last long trip; I tagged them in the packing list. THE PLAN: Complete 7-ish phases of travel across 27+ countries and end up in Australia/NZ around September/October 2026 * Baltics (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland) * Balkans (Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, Montenegro, Albania, North Macedonia, Serbia) * Southern Africa (South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe) * East Africa (Tanzania, Kenya, and possibly Uganda and/or Rwanda) * South Asia (India, Sri Lanka, Nepal) * SEA (Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Indonesia) * Oceania (Australia, New Zealand) BAG: A brand new Osprey Nebula 32L in Cascade Blue/Coal Grey - this will be its inauguration so I’m really hoping that I’ve selected well! I’ve switched to a more structured backpack mostly due to a lot more rugged conditions planned for this go-round and a higher likelihood of lengthy travel legs where the comfort of carrying a \\~15kg load becomes more important. I’ve also switched to an REI packable 16L backpack rather than a one-shoulder tote for the same reason.

I fully recognize that I am a lucky lady and that I don’t need too many specialized products!) * Matador FlatPak toiletry case * Muji medicine holder (Ibuprofen, melatonin, sleeping pills, Pepto Bismol pills, Dramamine, Imodium) * Muji refillable 100 mL containers x2 * Cuticle clippers aka mini scissors * Tweezerman tweezers * Tweezerman nail clippers * Bobby pins &amp; hair ties * Quip rechargeable toothbrush * Jordan flosser stick * Tongue scraper - not pictured * Remington bikini line hair trimmer * Mach 3 razor * Braun bug bite zapper - not pictured, but I swear by this thing!

Here is my story which may sound like a movie. (I asked this question a couple of days back in r/delhi, and it was interesting to see the experiences of many people, so I thought to ask it on this sub too. I'm copy-pasting my experience.) So, this happened last year in mid-2024. We were all 21-22 year olds Engineering Students doing our summer internship at a renowned tech company in Noida. There was a 21 year old girl with us in the same company, who was pursuing [B.Tech](http://B.Tech) in Computer Science from one of the top colleges in Delhi (One of it from IIITD, DTU and NSUT). She was brilliant-with exceptional Coding skills and Tech knowledge, and was very hardworking. We were 5–6 students there from different colleges but we all quickly bonded well and became friends. That girl was pretty friendly, had a great sense of humour, smart and was very humble with everybody, and was gorgeous. She looked to hail from a well to do but grounded family. If I go in little detail: 1. She used to dress very well but not flashy and had 3-4 pairs of shoes that she repeated alternatively. All were from brands like Puma and Adidas. 2. She used an iPhone 13 Pro Max-an almost 3 year old model then as it was launched in 2021, and had Airpods as well as a Macbook. 3. She had amazing communication skills and spoke fluent English with a mix of modern slang and impressed us all with her knowledge—not just in tech, but also in geo-politics, economics, and even Sanskrit. She often quoted the Bhagavad Gita and would explain deep philosophical meanings from it, and all of were very impressed as well as initially surprised. As I'm into spirituality too, we both used to have a good time discussing many aspects of this and I learnt a lot from her. 4. She was very respectful towards everyone and used to speak to the Senior Engineers or the peon/security guard with the same politeness. 5. She used to reside in Noida itself and come to the Office via Metro and E-rickshaw. First, she to used to board from a Metro station nearest to her home in Noida, come to the nearest metro station of Office and then take an E-rickshaw to reach the Office which was about 2-3 kilometres away from the Metro station. In all, she seemed to come from an upper middle class family as per Delhi NCR standards-comfortable, but not ultra-rich. As many youngsters today own an iPhone (For example-I don't come from a rich family (maybe upper middle class) and myself owned an iPhone) and Airpods and branded Shoes, it was kind off ordinary and not something out of the World. Days and weeks passed. After the working hours, we all (5–6 people) used to eat the street food like Golgappe (that she loved the most) and Momo together after the office hours and were having a good time. She didn’t seem to be different from us at all in terms of financial background. Until one day. It was the time of mid-August, and there was a sudden and heavy rain at the evening right after the working hours. We were all standing near the gate inside the Office premises chit-chatting and looking at the rain and waiting for it to stop, but it didn’t give any such signs. 15-20 minutes passed but still, it was raining heavily. 2 people booked cabs and left. We were 4 people left now, when I asked her plans about leaving. She said she would wait for another 10 minutes and if she still couldn’t find any E-rickshaw, then she will “see”. As it was raining heavily, there were no E-rickshaws nearby too. (She used to take an E-rickshaw to the Metro station daily.) Neither the rain stopped nor she could find any E-rickshaw and 10 minutes passed. As I was observing her, she sent a text to somebody and right after a minute, got a call. She spoke something for 20 seconds or so and went near the gate and started walking back and forth there as she was waiting for someone. We all went there too and started chit-chatting among ourselves when, after around 10 minutes-"}

Turn on the gas. The creature cooks without ever realizing its desperate situation. Nature played a cruel trick on the frog leaving it vulnerable to external forces. Only the stupidest creatures expose themselves to threats of their own making. Henry the balding idiot prince and his used pleasure appliance are such stupid creatures. The response to the court case Friday by the Montecito morons was nothing less than the last test of their suitability for life in polite society and they failed miserably. And the verdict was issued by the palace itself. The judgement released by the court today was issued at Easter giving the morons of Montecito weeks to prepare a response. The interview Harry gave and the statements they issued were not knee jerk responses. They revealed two people so full of their own bullshit they could not see beyond it. They could not imagine that the palace would have any public response to their bullshit. The frog prince and his concubine thought they could rely on the grayrocking to continue no matter what they did. They even tested the waters by throwing an hrh picture up on meghans self love fest to make sure their continued silence could be relied upon. Like the reptile that is his spirit animal, the frog prince is unaware of who he is and where he is in the world he has created. Allow me to rant with a bit of history before tying the final knot around these narcissists. Their lives today are a complete mess. Just listing their biggest catastrophes is challenging. She has failed as an author, a humanitarian, a fire warden and a philanthropist. Her oprah interview was an embarrassment of lies, reinforced by a Netflix series that tried to build on her deceptions. Netflix, lemonada, Disney and the introduction of her lifestyle brands have been spectacular failures. She was branded a grifter by Spotify execs. This useless twit has been publicly exposed as a bully in europe amd north america, with rumors of her bullying extending to 3 other continents. Her poison has spilled onto his reputation with invictus. From leading wounded soldiers while cosplaying a street walker in germany to intruding on Harry's limelight in Canada, she has markled his involvement in his pet project. He wrote a book that proved his willingness to compromise his integrity to maintain the facade of his relevance. In the oprah interview and their fictional fuck-you-mentary series these two grifters clung to each other's lies as they weaved their new house of deception. He walked away from his responsibilities with African Parks and walked away from a second charity when his entitlement was called out and his charitable intentions legally challenged. His involvement in Better Up has led to layoffs of individuals who questioned if the job description of \"chief impact officer\" included driving away business. His ability to purchase awards for himself and his wife has helped expose the hypocrisy of the celebrity machine. From claiming to be a private jet flying environmentalist, a bunker bound war hero, a legend of aviation with an unverified pilot's license and receiving the Pat Tillman award over the objection of Pat's mother, Henry was determined not to let his wife outshine him in questionable accomplishments. These and many more of their dubious achievements have led these idiots to the precipice of bankruptcy and irrelevance. And now we arrive at the court case, their response and the choices that lie ahead. The loss of his court case friday and a million pound legal bill was not enough to bring this idiot down to earth. He continued to plead his case to higher authorities who have zero interest in being Harry's savior. If they actually looked at their situation they would realize the water is boiling over. They are convinced that they control the heating element. And really, what"}

See the solution we built and learn how that foundation allowed the school to shift to remote learning in 2020. ***TL;DR:*** *With a small team already pushed to the limit, North Central Missouri College (NCMC) turned to* [CDW for help overhauling their systems](https://www.cdw.com/content/cdw/en/articles/datacenter/digital-transformation-at-north-central-missouri-college.html)*. From a brand-new data center and video surveillance system to upgraded wired and wireless networks, there was a lot of work to be done. Once everything was up-and-running, they realized dramatic time savings – extensive weekly patching was a thing of the past. And better yet, the infrastructure was already in place to support remote learning when classes went virtual.* https://preview.redd.it/dwvyomd7skm81.png?width=2872&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a373ca320bdeb9bdd4851501b56f2fb0e9ca4b0 When Jennifer Triplett stepped into her new job as CIO at North Central Missouri College, she knew what she was getting into. NCMC had brought her on in the summer of 2019 to lead an IT department of nine people. A two-year community college founded in 1925, the school’s main campus is in the city of Trenton, Mo., but it also operates through several other sites and serves students across a total of 16 counties. As the institution looked ahead to its 100th anniversary, it hoped to find a way to modernize its IT systems. Her first major mission, Triplett recalls, was to get a feel for the “current state” so her team could develop a roadmap for implementation. https://preview.redd.it/un5hn896rkm81.jpg?width=472&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6d2d3cbc97650169eb64fa657d3376838aa163e “What we found was that most of our technology was either out of date or soon to be out of date,” she says. “Even with some of the things we’d put in relatively recently, we were being hit with really high renewal costs, and it just wasn’t sustainable.” Triplett says students and instructors were also complaining about wireless network performance, while video security across the school’s sites was in dire need of a major upgrade. Then there was the matter of its aging data center, which appeared to be on its last legs. “We had discs failing, hosts failing, everything was failing,” she explains. “The overhead with managing that infrastructure had become significant. We were constantly having to troubleshoot failed hardware.” With the data center as her primary objective, Triplett reached out to CDW and met with account manager Brendan Murphy. That was followed by several site visits by a team of CDW solution architects and engineers. Soon, she says, it became perfectly clear what NCMC needed to do.

The third scenario, “Transform,” described institutions that would use the upheaval to reimagine and redefine their operations. The report didn’t mention NCMC, which partnered with CDW shortly before the pandemic hit, but the project the college launched is a textbook example of the type of transformation EDUCAUSE authors had in mind. “From a pandemic perspective,” Triplett says, “the need for rock-solid IT became even more important than i"}

([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1u6dcP\\_JNc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1u6dcP_JNc)) &amp;#x200B; Doyouconsideryourselfafeminist (DYCYAF) started as an instagram account asking men on tinder that exact question and posting the (usually ridiculous) answers. She existed in the same instagram realm as whydidyouswiperighttho or datingjustsucks. She ended up getting to I think about 50k followers before the account was deleted. On the new accounts she made, she expressed a lot of fear and frustration over the deletion of her account for all the support she does for the feminist community and was very critical of people reporting posts because it threatened her entire platform and all of these \"opportunities\" she'd been offered supposedly from publications. Basically, this is where things started getting weird and moving away from tinder convos. &amp;#x200B; A little background on DYCYAF: the account was run by a girl named Sarah KP (some people had her on facebook and that was her facebook name) who claimed to be a North African/Moroccan activist/academic from Montreal. She claimed to have an auto-immune disease and should've already been dead, but definitely doesn't have more than 5 years left. As a result, she could never have kids and would probably never find love, but she was fine with that because she refused to lower her standards just because she was lonely. She had the perfect ex-boyfriend named Alistair who was some type of rich, British, academic of some political family (she might have claimed he was royalty I can't exactly remember) and they met at Harvard or University of Oxford and broke up because even though he was so good, she was still better than him and because he was white. She often posted text or facebook conversations between them with him praising her or some weird back and forth about privilege etc. Not surprisingly, he had the same text style as Sarah KP, which was written off because they were so close and knew each other for so long. One iconic story about Sarah came from Alistair after his friend messaged him \"Mate you mind if I ask your ex bird out? She's hardcore like me I fancy that.\" Alistair proceeds to prove no one is as \"hardcore\" as Sarah and launches off into a story about how they were in Palestine during a bombing and Sarah saved a child hiding under a car, despite Alistair trying to pull her to safety, and ruined her knees in the process, all while wearing designer heels. Or how she humiliated a man in an \"impromptu comedy act\" at a charity ball for making a joke about the black singers, ultimately causing this man to double his donations. &amp;#x200B; These personal stories, usually shared through the scope of a \"friend\" praising Sarah, started to get sprinkled into her profile probably about a year and a half before the Great Callout. The original account pretty strictly only shared on-brand content, like the tinder convos and other feminist discourse. Towards the end of her profile, there were almost no tinder conversations being posted at all and turned into more of a cult. I kept following because it was easy enough to ignore her humble bragging and she still shared content that I enjoyed. The cult mentality started to get out of control when she started enlisting her followers to harass people that either disagreed with her, reported her, or \"stole\" from her. &amp;#x200B; One instance I remember being really turned off by was when she sent her followers to attack the author of a New York Times author that wrote about Disney princes as feminists or something. Sarah shared the NYT article on her page, it might have just been screenshots of it. The author of the article reached out to Sarah to thank her for sharing and"}

My last lengthy one bag stint featured the Matador SEG30 (discontinued, but I still have mine and love it dearly) was in 2022; I visited 11 countries in around 6 months, working all the while. I actually cataloged some of my adventures on this account, including my original packing list! Fun memories to dig up and very interesting to compare my packing list now. This time around I’ll be doing some more adventurous travel and leaving behind my DN-friendly work setup. I’ve upgraded a lot of my gear, but there are still some proven winners from my last long trip; I tagged them in the packing list. THE PLAN: Complete 7-ish phases of travel across 27+ countries and end up in Australia/NZ around September/October 2026 * Baltics (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland) * Balkans (Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, Montenegro, Albania, North Macedonia, Serbia) * Southern Africa (South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe) * East Africa (Tanzania, Kenya, and possibly Uganda and/or Rwanda) * South Asia (India, Sri Lanka, Nepal) * SEA (Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Indonesia) * Oceania (Australia, New Zealand) BAG: A brand new Osprey Nebula 32L in Cascade Blue/Coal Grey - this will be its inauguration so I’m really hoping that I’ve selected well! I’ve switched to a more structured backpack mostly due to a lot more rugged conditions planned for this go-round and a higher likelihood of lengthy travel legs where the comfort of carrying a \\~15kg load becomes more important.

As one of the archivists working on the subject said, **\"What would be a huge help is just getting these photos in front of a bunch of 80 and 90-year-olds.\"**) In the mid to late 1950s, two men in their 20s or 30s married each other in what appears to be a small ceremony in an apartment. Somebody at the wedding took candid shots of the grooms exchanging rings before an officiant, sharing their first kiss as newlyweds, opening gifts and cutting their wedding cake, as well as of guests enjoying themselves and dancing. A person or persons (see below) dropped off the film with the wedding photos at a neighborhood drugstore in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1957. After developing the photos, however, the drugstore's manager deemed them \"inappropriate\" and refused to return them to the customer(s). One of his employees kept the photos, intending to return them if she ever saw that customer again, but they never came back. The 21 prints ended up with the personal photos of the drugstore employee. Her daughter found them in the early 2010s, and today they are the shared property of the ONE National Gay and Lesbian Archives at USC and the John J. Wilcox Jr. Archives at the William Way LGBT Center. **Archivists at both are seeking to identify the grooms and return to them this piece of their lives that was stolen.** The prints can be viewed here: [https://www.ouronestory.com/1957-gay-wedding](https://www.ouronestory.com/1957-gay-wedding) WHAT WE KNOW: * The roll of film was dropped off at a drugstore/photo shop at **Broad Street and Allegheny Avenue** in **North Philadelphia** in **1957**. It seems PLAUSIBLE that the wedding also took place in Philadelphia, but this is not certain. 1957 is also a very plausible year for the photos, based on the clothing, hairstyles, and interior decorating visible. * The majority of the participants (grooms, officiant, guests) are **white men between the ages of about 20-60**. (At least one white woman is partially visible in the background of a few shots.) Their birth years are circa 1897-1937. A person who was 25 in 1957 has a birth year of 1932 and would be **87 years old in 2019.** That's about all which is certain. Other factors that may be important in identifying the participants include: * **The families of the two grooms may never have known** that their sons/brothers/uncles were in a committed relationship. Same-sex marriage and sexual relations were illegal in the US, and would be for decades to come. If the couple lived together, which seems likely, they may have been \"roommates\" or may not have even been known to each other's families. * The wedding and reception were a small, intimate affair. Before the 1960s, local gay communities placed **discretion and secrecy** in high regard, knowing they could pay the price if they didn't. The LGBT archivists and researchers interviewed on the photo mystery are unanimous that photos like these are rare for that very reason. * The comments of the July post to this sub (linked below) speculated a lot about **why the person(s) who dropped off the film would have done so at a drugstore photo shop**, if they knew the photos could potentially \"out\" people or be confiscated. Some of the articles state or imply that one or both of the grooms took the film to the drugstore, but that is not certain at all; the nameless drugstore employee who took the prints home had passed away before her daughter found them, and the back story we have is what the employee had told her husband about them. The upcoming docu-series about the photos may reveal more information. Anyway, to return to the point, we don't know if the person who dropped off the film knew what was on it. Maybe it was an unprocessed roll they took for their brother or friend. Or maybe they just didn't thi"}

NXT has now switched to a more character-building mode, which means now is a great time to jump into the developmental brand and learn from fresh. *** **NXT'S STYLE** *** First up, NXT 2.0 has been dead for a WHILE now, but in the last calendar year NXT has strongly stripped away the odd booking that permeated the colour era. White and Gold NXT is very firmly a developmental brand, so it’s worth going into it knowing that the stars on the show are not finished products. Fans of the show are much more forgiving to its stars and adopt a much stronger “wait and see” attitude to that of fans of the main roster. The intimate setting of NXT also hugely helps with crowd interaction, and fans will have some unique crowd chants for stars very early on. The entire atmosphere has a very “college” feel, tends to be more lighthearted and seems much more specifically catered towards young adults. With Ilja Dragunov and Carmelo Hayes at the helm, NXT White and Gold had the best year in NXT’s history, and with those two stars moving up, NXT has changed drastically. *** **NXT'S TV AND PLE FORMATS** *** NXT actually has 2 shows; NXT and NXT Lvl Up. Both shows are filmed in the Performance Centre every week, fostering a specific fanbase for the brand in the same way that a territory like ECW did. Lvl Up, formerly 205 Live, is basically developmental for the developmental, with lowercard and midcard talents that may not otherwise get large amounts of ring time being afforded a spotlight. Lvl Up stories do not usually translate over to NXT proper. NXT’s specials format is split between 2 week TV events and PLEs, alternating between the two every month. Almost all these events use old PLE names that were used in WWE, WCW or ECW but have been since discontinued by WWE’s main roster, such as Battleground, The Great American Bash, Heatwave, Vengeance Day, etc. Stand and Deliver is NXT’s Wrestlemania, and takes place on Mania Saturday Morning. Last year’s event list was: - *Spring Breakin’ (Special)* - **Battleground (PLE)** - *Gold Rush (Special)* - **The Great American Bash (PLE)** - *Heatwave (Special)* - **No Mercy (PLE)** - *Halloween Havoc (Special)* - **Deadline (PLE)** - *New Year’s Evil (Special)* - **Vengeance Day (PLE)** - *Roadblock (Special)* - **Stand And Deliver (PLE)** *** **NXT'S ACCOLADES** *** NXT, just like the main roster, has its own special prizes to be won. The biggest of these are the Breakout Tournaments, the Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic, and the Iron Survivor Match. - The Breakout Tournaments are 2 tournaments, one male and one female, held between 8 rookies each, all of whom have only been on NXT TV for less than a year. The winners of these tournaments receive a contract that is basically NXT’s Money in the Bank; they can get a title shot for a championship of their choosing at any time. The main difference is that Tag Championships are also on the table, and midcard belts are frequently selected for cash-ins. - The Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic is a tag team tournament, and the rules change ALL the time, but presently, 8 male teams go into this single elimination tournament, and if the winners are not already the NXT Tag Team Champions, they receive a shot at the championships at Vengeance Day (January). - The Iron Survivor match happens at the Deadline PLE (December) every year and is an absolutely electric match type. 5 superstars compete, and 2 start in the ring, with a new one entering every 5 minutes until all are in the ring. The time limit is 25 minutes and whoever scores the most falls will win the match. There’s an added twist however; if you give up a fall, be it through pinfall or submission, you are sent into a penalty box and are unable to pick up any falls for 90 seconds. The winner receives a championship match at the TV"}
