Hello, you may know me from the Cuck Chronicles, TikTok Drama, etc. Today I will write a relatively short post on the recent Taylor Swift Superbowl Drama that has been blown up, its not as entertaining as my prior post, but its entertaining enough that I will write about it --------------------------------- Context - A few days ago, The Eagles beat the KC Chiefs in the Superbowl. Taylor Swift and the President supported the KC Chiefs (more on how the president matters tangentially in this). Taylor because her boyfriend is in the Chiefs. The loss was pretty large margin wise, with Chief fans leaving early, such as the President. Swifties, are known as a very very very rabid fanbase on par with Kpop fans and gacha fans. They then started by review bombing the restaurant of one of the Eagles player's MOM's restaurants in Florida. Then they got a littttttle more unhinged and racist as over the course of a few hours they started calling the ICE tipline and then leaving racist remarks on his mom and family. The story, as of now has hit international news, but it started on X and Reddit swift fan groups and these posts are BEFORE it reached international news.

Hodges https://www.reddit.com/r/GayConservative/comments/1mng9kg/supreme_court_formally_asked_to_overturn_landmark/ # Background: [Kim Davis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Davis) is a former county clerk for Rowan County, Kentucky who gained notoriety in 2015 after defying a court order compelling her to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples in the wake of *[Obergefell v. Hodges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obergefell_v._Hodges)*. Davis, who has been married four times and had only recently converted to Christianity at the time, stated that it would \"violate [her] conscience\" to issue marriage licenses in violation of \"God's definition of marriage\", and claimed that the First Amendment right to religious freedom exempted her from having to comply with the outcome of *Obergefell*. In an attempt to circumvent the Supreme Court's decision, Davis refused to issue marriage licenses to any couples regardless of sex. Unsurprisingly, a [lawsuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_v._Davis) was filed against her, ultimately culminating in the U.S. District Court ordering her to issue marriage licenses to all couples. Davis appealed the ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals, and when that failed, she turned to the Supreme Court and was denied once again. Following the court's decision, Davis continued to deny marriage licenses to couples despite the court's orders. Davis was jailed for contempt of court, and was released after five days on the condition that she not prevent her deputy clerks from issuing marriage licenses in her place. In July 2025, Davis [submitted a petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-formally-asked-overturn-landmark-same-sex/story?id=124465302) requesting that *Obergefell v. Hodges* be overturned, citing *[Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women%27s_Health_Organization)* as precedent. This has been met with concern, as the current Supreme Court is majority conservative, with Justice Thomas [specifically citing *Obergefell* as a case he'd like to overturn](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/thomas-wants-supreme-court-overturn-landmark-rulings-legalized-contrac-rcna35228) in his concurrence on *Dobbs*. # Highlights: [Who saw that coming?](https://www.reddit.com/r/GayConservative/comments/1mng9kg/supreme_court_formally_asked_to_overturn_landmark/n8526ox/) &gt; Stevie Wonder even saw this üò≠ ___ [Good job everybody.

Edit - Well damn. EPS and revenue beat but guidance is king these days. Holding onto the calls at this point in case a miracle happens but counting the full 8k as a loss. Only down 1.7k on shares so far but if it does the same thing it has done the last 3 quarters, it will rebound to new highs so not too worried. Congratulations to all the Bears and better luck next time to all the Bulls with me. I believe BBWI is going to crush earnings based on 5 months of store stalking and no one is talking about it. Literally not one mention about earnings on wallstreetbets. TLDR at the end. **Background:** I have been on paternity leave for a little over 5 months now. I live 20 minutes away from 3 different malls and thought I walking around them for an hour or two every day would be a great way to kill some time while also letting my newborn see new things. Around the same time I watched a video on how a Chinese coffee shop got outed for fake financials by people literally watching the store and counting the number of people buying things. That gave me the idea to track how many people were in stores and how many shopping bags I saw around the mall from each store indicating a purchase. Obviously there is a major difference between dozens of people watching stores vs just little old me but the data I gathered has been spot on for earning beats on what I considered to be outliers. The stores that have surprised me with their high volume are Gap, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, Urban Outfitters, Sephora, and of course Bath and Body Works. **Method:** All in all I have 124 days worth of data so far. I usually only visit one mall a day but sometimes two. Any day of the week and usually between 12pm and 5pm. I try and park at different entrances so I don‚Äôt get biased in my counting of bags because I park right next to one store or another. I go to three different malls each catering to a different economic class. Pretty much lower, middle, and high income. I do 2 passes, about and hour apart, of each store I am tracking. I count the number of customers in the store. While I walk around, I also count the number of bags I see from each store. This is a bit harder to trust though as people with multiple bags usually condense into one. So stores with small bags (looking at you Sephora) are underrepresented. I would occasionally go into BBWI and count the items in people carts too but only did this a handful of times. **Data:** The average number of people I have seen at BBWI is 9.82 on weekdays and 23.68 on weekends. This crushes the average from all the stores I tracked which was 2.98 on weekdays and 8.2 on weekends. The only store with a higher average was Sephora which was 10.36 and 25.25 respectfully. All three malls had similar numbers with the higher income mall being slightly higher but not enough to note. I think this was due to young girls traveling in packs of 3 or 4 which I didn‚Äôt see at the other two malls. The average number of bags (aka purchases) for BBWI was 4.1 on weekdays and 11.67 on weekends. Which again crushes the average of just 1.45 and 3.11. For some context here are pictures of the check out line Saturday 30 minutes apart. Wanted to hide people because I think it is rude for a random stranger to snap pictures of people and post them online. There are currently multiple tellers checking out customers with 5 more people in line. https://preview.redd.it/j7utbegx6d4d1.png?width=1485&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66905e26bba9ebd5134ef3e817efaaf26b45b8cc 30 minutes later and still 5 people in line https://preview.redd.it/dbjon4ep6d4d1.png?width=1493&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ce85d8724ee99cd47b3e79a3b0bbaa7112b79bc **Other Things to Note** **Male Skin Care** \\- Something I didn‚Äôt track, but surprised me, was the number of males in the store alone or with another guy (this goes for Sephora as well).

The MOASS is upon us. For real. Hello beautiful apes, I have some things to share with you that I feel we need to internalize as a community. This is not hopium, and it is not FUD. This is somewhere in the middle. Giving a realistic perspective on what's actually going on. And it is important that we grasp the severity of the real situation so no one gets trapped anymore. And the real reason why MOASS is finally upon us. No hype baiting, no calls to action, no dates. Just sharing my perspective with some strong opinions, speculation, a fun story, and some pictures of charts. There are 3 sections. **Section 1: Addressing today** **Section 2: Story / Thought Experiment** **Section 3: Review of charts with lessons learned.** &amp;#x200B; Let's get into it. &amp;#x200B; **Section 1: Addressing today** I know today sucked. I'm mad that I was right. I was hoping it wouldn't be a rug pull. I was hoping the subtle call to action with a time sensitivity that came out of nowhere promising the moon if you do this **one thing**... would be true. But we need to learn from this. I posted 2 posts prior to this one saying to be skeptical about it. But because neither post went with the narrative being spun, it didn't get any traction. I tried to warn to be cautious of the options trap. My only thought was.. this looks too perfect. It has to be a trap. Because MOASS will just fucking happen.. It won't be laid out on the charts. It won't be a subtle bread crumb that we find. It won't be predictable. Someone's not going to come out of nowhere and say \"GUYS LOOK AT THIS THING I FOUND IN THE CHART AND IT WILL HAPPEN ON THIS DAY AND ONLY THIS DAY BECAUSE XYZ\"... It will be a sudden violent shift up. It will be a fucking Tsunami that hits everyone by surprise. It will be an asteroid in the dark. A black hole that swallows the entire financial sector and there's not a damned thing they can do to stop it. And not a damned thing any one of us, neither individually nor collectively can do to make it happen any faster. The only thing I as an individual investor can do to secure the investment that I believe in, is to buy, hold and make sure that share is in my fucking name by direct registering it. That's all. Nothing else. Options.. somebody show me one law that states MM must hedge with **shares** which drives a gamma squeeze? Someone show me a law that states the calls being exercised must be purchased on a **lit exchange**, and can **not** be a synthetic fake share that they internalized? BY ALL MEANS if you want to buy calls, and exercise them.. Go for it. That is your right as an investor. Make your bets. And exercise your rights if you feel inclined. But make sure those shares are DRS'd once you receive them. Because if you're exercising with the idea that it will create a gamma squeeze, that won't happen. Not when they control the whole system. This whole game, the system of rules and regulations and agencies to protect investors and the media are all controlled by them. They are created by them, for them. The call battle was lost today due to people trading options on emotions. Not logic. They used emotions to bait people into buying calls and pulled the rug from under them. *NONE OF THIS IS FINANCIAL ADVICE. I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR. I'M JUST AN IDIOT WHO PUSHES BUTTONS AND EATS CRAYONS AND WRITES IN CAPS SOMETIMES.* If you're brand new to this game, this story will help you understand what's really going on behind the scenes and realize that the game is already won and there's nothing we can do except BUY, HODL and DRS. &amp;#x200B; And here's why I believe that: &amp;#x200B; **Section 2: Story / Thought experiment** Let's imagine a group of con artists comes up with a game.

Meanwhile Johnson and JB Pritzker are filming TikToks of themselves at 7am in the morning near areas like Lincoln Park and Lakeshore Drive saying how safe it is and that ‚Äúthe Republicans just got it wrong, man!‚Äù - coming to the defense of literal career criminals over, say, law abiding citizens who just want to live peacefully in the city. It's political suicide. \"I don't want to be murdered on the bus/train\" is now a partisan, far-right statement. It‚Äôs literally just tribal politics at this point. You have to commit to being against whatever the other team is for, even if it makes you look completely ridiculous to a normal person / median voter. In this case, Republicans claimed the mantle of caring about crime, disorder on the streets etc., so Democrats have a knee jerk response to either dismissing these as ‚Äúfake concerns‚Äù or pooh-poohing literally any policies to try and address these problem head-on. Doing so would also be a tacit admission that decades of democratic policies in various cities have failed to address these problems, hence the silly and limp-wristed insistence that crime stats are marginally improving every year, etc. Their only real idealogy is not doing anything to disrupt the status quo (you know, the status quo every American loves, where freaks who are one wrong look away from murdering you in cold blood are just out walking the streets alongside everyone else). Not one single 2028 contender for the Democrats is getting ahead of these political issues and saying \"Yeah, we messed up, we do need to do better on crime.\" It honestly feels like the majority of the Democratic platform for the past decade is just \"What is Trump doing now? Oh okay, well we're against that\"."}

The only current NBA teams that existed at all yet were the Sacramento Kings and the Detroit Pistons, and they would be unrecognizable to most, then known as the Rochester Seagrams and Fort Wayne Zollners. Well over half the pro players were off at war, which forced the league to compress down to five teams. Two of those teams were brand new, and one of them shut down four games into the season, cutting the league to just four teams.

According to fans, Johnson strayed too far from the path set by J.J. Abrams, generating a fragmented and contradictory history. However, blaming Rian Johnson alone would be an oversimplification. The truth is that The Force Awakens wasn't a good movie either. It was a blatant copy of A New Hope. Fans often remember it with nostalgia, as a broken promise or the first glimmer of hope after years of silence. But that promise was hollow from the start: The Force Awakens was a corporate play carefully designed to stir predictable emotions, not to tell a new story. It was a product born in a marketing laboratory, not in the mind of a creator with an artistic vision. J.J. Abrams, aware of the rejection that many fans felt towards the Prequels, decided to play it safe: imitate the Original Trilogy in form, rhythm and structure. In the process, he betrayed the original plans that George Lucas had written before selling Lucasfilm. Abrams and Disney feared risk and therefore sacrificed imagination. What moved the company was not the Star Wars myth or its narrative potential, but its value as an image and as a brand. Disney did not buy Star Wars to continue an epic, but to exploit a collective nostalgia. His goal was to emotionally ‚Äúreactivate‚Äù the audience, not offer them something new. The strategy was simple: take every iconic element of the Original Trilogy, wrap it in a modern design, and present it as a ‚Äútriumphant return.‚Äù In reality, The Force Awakens was a covert remake, a repackaged version of Episode IV, conceived by an algorithm that is afraid of risk. It was less an act of love for cinema than an exercise in commercial calculation. At this point, Star Wars stopped being a story and became a simulation of itself: an empty representation, perfectly designed to provoke dopamine in the viewer. The saddest thing is that it worked. The filming of The Force Awakens was promoted as an homage to ‚Äúclassic cinema‚Äù: 35mm filming, real sets, practical effects, models and animatronic creatures. Everything seemed like a return to the artisanal spirit of Lucas's cinema. But what was presented as authenticity was, in reality, a meticulous simulacrum, a staging designed to disguise its prefabricated nature. While the public cried with emotion at the supposed revival of Star Wars, no one stopped to ask why the air in the theater smelled so much of plastic and cheap nostalgia. George Lucas was one of the few voices to speak out against this approach. He described The Force Awakens as a soulless repetition, a betrayal of the experimental spirit that had characterized his work. But society, intoxicated by marketing, ridiculed him. The irony is cruel: the creator of Star Wars was silenced by the same cultural machine his universe had helped inspire. And yet, Disney won. The Force Awakens grossed more than two billion dollars, surpassing The Phantom Menace and becoming the highest-grossing film of 2015, as well as the biggest commercial success in the history of The Walt Disney Company. Disney showed that, in contemporary cinema, you don't need to have imagination to succeed; It is enough to know how to manipulate the emotional memory of the public. Star Wars was no longer a saga about the Force, myth or redemption. It was, and remains, a mirror of our consumer culture: a packaged souvenir, a recyclable product designed to sell the illusion of return. Disney profoundly transformed the narrative legacy left by George Lucas. Far from continuing the story of redemption, victory and hope built in the first six films, this new trilogy ends up rendering them practically useless. The defeat of the Galactic Empire, the sacrifice of Darth Vader, and the achievements of the original heroes become meaningless in the face of the events presented in t"}

However, the original author seems to have either deleted their account or taken the post down, so I decided to revive the post. Back when Removeedit worked for Reddit posts I could link to the text itself but that unfortunately seems to have shut down. Anyway, let's get into this: &gt; **What's Critical Role?** Beginning in early 2015, Critical Role is a live-streamed game of Dungeons and Dragons helmed by several popular voice actors such as Matthew Mercer (Jotaro Kujo, Leon Kennedy, [Maximus from Leo the Lion\\)](https://twitter.com/matthewmercer/status/972360731567050752?lang=en), Travis Willingham (Thor, Roy Mustang, [this store owner in Nip/Tuck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu95M2Xy2Ig)) and Laura Bailey (Rise from Persona 4, the Female Boss in Saints Row 3/4, [Kaine in Nier\\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E71tZ-NWPIg). If you were an anime fan watching dubs from the mid 2000s to the mid 2010s or you just played a video game, I guarantee you heard at least one of these actors in something. It's a veritable who's-who of big name voice actors. While recording for Resident Evil 6, Mercer decided to give a birthday present to Liam O'Brien, specifically a one-shot D&amp;D game. This was run in the... controversial... 4th edition version of the game, and presumably after Mercer took a visit to his local exorcist, realized the error of his ways. When O'Brien expressed interest in continuing the game, Mercer agreed and they shifted to Pathfinder. The crew share some stories as they go, with it becoming a frequent thing that gets brought up during convention panels as a fun aside. Back before Vine died it was very common to see the actors making Vines of tabletop moments, and some of the original campaign was preserved [through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-M5NH9PGi4) [Youtube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rsks5PWfG8) The team go by the name Vox Machina- latin for Voice Machine, but initially they operated under the name Super High Intensity Team, or... The SHITS. I will actually be shocked if they refernece that old name in the cartoon. The party for Campaign 1 consisted of: * Matt Mercer as DM. * Marisha Ray as Keyleth, Half-Elf Druid. * Liam O'Brien as Vax, Half-Elf Rogue. * Laura Bailey as Vex, Half-Elf Ranger. * Travis Willingham as Grog, Goliath Barbarian. * Ashley Johnson as Pike, Gnome Cleric. * Sam Riegel as Scanlan, Gnome Bard. * Taliesen Jaffe as Percy, Human Fighter. * Orion Acaba as Tiberius, Dragonborn Sorcerer. Fast forward about two years and Ashley Johnson is at a small party where she meets up with Felicia Day, who is running a nerdy celebrity Youtube channel called Geek and Sundry. Ashley shares some stories about the game and Felicia offers them a show slot on their Twitch channel, seeing potential for this to go far. And as such, on March 3rd, 2015, after an internal conversion to Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition (a move that I'm pretty sure that the 5e team thank God for given how much money they've made that brand), [Critical Role would begin its slow, gradual process towards world domination.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-p9lWIhcLQ) This first episode is *jank* and I adore it with every fibre of my soul.

From [Peter Johnson](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0814255/) to [Ong](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0938283/), there have been a whole host of bad adaptations, leaving fans of any book terrified when news of an adaptation is announced. But one man had a brilliant idea. What if, the issue with all those previous adaptations was that they ruined *too little*? What if, the answer was to take all the most beloved plots and characters of 41 separate books, mash them up into a disgusting homunculus, shove some steampunk up its ass, and ruin all of them *together*? Oh, and also disrespect the beloved dead author whose express wishes you're ignoring, and kick out his daughter. Welcome to *The Watch*. **Disclaimer**: At certain points during this write up, you may think, \"Gee, this whole thing just seems like a massive ad to get people to read Terry Pratchett's work\". It is. You should read it. (Come on. Read it. You'll like it.) However, it's also a dive into some truly excellent drama, and a massive amount of untold history that I've done my best to dredge up and collect in one place. Hopefully, even if you're already aware of this, there'll be some new parts of it in here for you. A lot of this information has been kept as secret as the BBC could, or was scattered around. I tried to go a bit further than most of the news sources I found, and create a whole picture of *why* this became such a travesty. This is a topic I'm very passionate about, and the writeup can get a tad long, so I've included a TL;DR in bold at the end of each section in case you don't really care that much about the details, or get lost. # Our story begins... and a man's story ends **Who is Terry Pratchett?** (If you're asking this question, refer to the disclaimer above.) Terry Pratchett is one of the most successful and beloved fantasy(ish) authors in the business. His website [here](https://www.terrypratchettbooks.com/about-sir-terry/) has a dive into his life. The part that's most important to this writeup is his career as a writer, specifically, the Discworld series. Starting in 1983 with *The Color of Magic*, Pratchett would go on to write a staggering *41 books* in the Discworld series. Think of it almost like the MCU: there are many stories, some of which cross over, all existing in the same shared universe. These varied wildly; with one being about a turtle god, and the next being an in depth look at sexism in the military, while a third focused on the perils of having dwarves in your condom factory. Despite the varying topics, Sir Terry's trademark wry humor and satire was always present. One of the most popular sub-series is the eight City Watch books. It focuses on the Ankh Morpork Night's Watch, headed up by Sam Vimes, with a wide supporting cast. They were the underdog cops in a city where crime was legal. Vimes was one of Pratchett's most popular characters, an everyman who rose from being an impoverished drunk to the most respected and feared hand of justice in the world. It's a series full of discussion and satire on politics, monarchy, racism, sexism, and justice, which also has genuinely loveable characters in hilarious situations. Pratchett was also just a remarkably good person. He remained down to earth, living a modest lifestyle with his family even as he gained fame and money. His daughter Rhianna remembers him missing deadlines and work just so that he could take her out to explore the countryside, or tell her stories. He was ecstatic at receiving a knighthood, so much so that he forged his own sword out of a meteorite, and hid it afterwards, leaving it missing to this day. A lot of his ideas came from D&amp;D campaigns he'd run for kids while volunteering at the local library. And that's all setting aside the major donations he made to different charities"}

Originals posted by /u/ChessCheatConundrum in /r/AnarchyChess and on their profile.** Mood Spoilers: &gt;!Mostly just...weird?!&lt; ___________________ #[Chess club is run by a cheater. What should I do?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnarchyChess/comments/skw5jx/chess_club_is_run_by_a_cheater_what_should_i_do/) *- Feb 04, 2022* I recently began attending a new chess club that meets in person. After a few weeks, I discovered that the person who organizes it is a cheater. He uses his phone in a fairly elaborate way to determine the top computer moves, then plays those against unsuspecting opponents. He claims to be one of the best players in the state, but is actually a complete novice who barely understands the game. It looks like he‚Äôs been cheating for years, for literally every move he plays in every single game. There‚Äôs no financial incentive here, he just crushes amateurs every week in hours-long, casual games. What should I do about this? Anything at all? I haven‚Äôt told anyone yet and he doesn‚Äôt yet suspect I know. Should I mess with him? Call him out publicly? Ignore it and mind my own business? Is this something anyone else has experienced before? Any advice would be welcome. For the hardcore among you who want to know the full story with all the details, grab yourself a beverage, strap in, and enjoy: I just moved to a new area and saw the local library has weekly in-person chess club meetings. When I walked in, the organizer greeted me and asked if I was up for a game. I was, so he added a couple hours to the clock and we started to play. I didn‚Äôt think much of his phone and Bluetooth headset since he mentioned he was keeping track of sports scores. The more distractions for my opponent, I thought, the better. He played an opening I‚Äôm familiar with to a level past my familiarity. After about an hour and 20 moves later I blundered and was quickly checkmated. ‚ÄúGood game,‚Äù I said, and asked if he wanted to review. He stood over the board as I replayed the moves and quipped, ‚Äúyou messed up on move three. No coming back after that.‚Äù I was slightly offended because, while odd-looking, the move was the main theoretical reply, which he must have known since we both played it fairly deeply. He didn‚Äôt seem to recognize the name of the opening when I said it and just kind of shrugged and agreed with me before walking away. Maybe he had a super sarcastic or troll-like sense of humor, I figured. After analyzing the game in Stockfish I saw he played perfectly. 100% agreement with the engine which came out to 9 cpl. I made four inaccuracies with about 40 cpl. My GM coach rarely played this accurately against me but it was still possible, especially if I made early mistakes. I noticed a few other oddities like him avoiding a forcing, straightforward mate-in-9 sequence to find a complex and non-forcing mate-in-7. Also odd was how little time he spent on each move, especially compared to the first 2-3 moves which took him forever to decide upon. Overall, I was glad to have found such a strong player to learn from and looked up his rating. He had a USCF ID but no history of playing in the last 20 years. ‚ÄúI used to play tournaments in the 70‚Äôs and 80‚Äôs,‚Äù he later explained, claiming he was a 2250 National Master. ‚ÄúBut much stronger now.‚Äù Coincidentally it turns out my former coach was also a very prolific player during that time and in the same area, but the organizer didn‚Äôt recognize his name. And his USCF ID was only a few years old without any listed ratings or anything. I did a web search but the guy had seemingly no history beyond the club website which he wrote. There he listed himself as a 2203 NM. There was also a club ranking page with his name and photo and placed on top, with a description, ‚Äúregarded as the strongest player in {area} and one of the top players in {state}.‚Äù He ranked himself above a local \\~2300 FIDE Master, later claimi"}

My case to Padme in convincing her to stick with Anakin: 1. Stay with your husband during his career transition to a new organization. Is that really a tall ask? I also hear it's quite the promotion! 2. You don't get choked. Always a good thing! 3. No more sneaking around. AND your husband keeps a job without being ousted and publicly shamed for daring to have a personal life. How long was that really going to last, let's be honest, Padme... 4. You get to raise your kids, and Leia doesn't have only vague memories of you despite never meeting you. This is ideal! Your son won't have his entire life ruined, and your daughter won't have to be raised by Jimmy Smits! 5. The Jedi, in particular Windu, never trusted Anakin, and never treated him much better than he was treated when he was a slave. Even when his mother was in danger, it was not made a priority by the Jedi council. For a bunch of space monks claiming to be of the 'light' side, they show zero compassion or care for the alleged \"chosen one\". They treat him like a tool, and nothing more. As his wife, you should see this, and understand why this isn't a productive environment for your husband. Also, look how happy Palpy is, what a good guy! 6. Your husband possibly isn't doomed to be in an iron lung and gets to keep his Johnson. This is both good for him AND you! 7. You're already \"talking like a Separatist\", well good news! Your husband is going to be on their side... well, until he kills them... 8. Kids get the coolest \"Uncle\" (Palpatine) of all time! And future career options are massive! Helping your husband rule the galaxy... or working on a moisture farm, not a hard choice, here. 9. You can stay in politics! Don't worry about having your job at the Senate dismissed; You can become a regional governor! That has a nice ring to it! 10. You finally don't have to ride around the Galaxy in your old mirror paint job ship that has a replacement engine in it and needs a bunch of droids to keep the shields up. Let's trade in that sucker for a brand new Lambda Class Imperial Shuttle with TWO, count 'em TWO shield generators! Wow! 11. Alderaan likely won't be to be destroyed, now. You've literally saved the lives of millions of people, how noble! 12. Let's be real, the worst thing about all this is some kids disappear that you never met."}

My supervisor, who is a brand new 22 year old 2nd Lieutenant didn‚Äôt want to learn how to use the system and always made me book her trips for her last minute because I was an administrator. Anyways no matter how many times I told her she needed to do it herself and showed her how to use the system, she‚Äôd always wait until the last minute to get anything done and book her flights. Because of this I was always having to get on the phone with the commercial travel office to book her flights last minute. Finally I had enough and figured this girl is never going to do this herself and I will always be stuck taking care of it last minute. So I started booking her trips for her in DTS as she had wanted me to do all along. So I did. I made sure her flight left at the earliest possible time and had the longest layovers available, seat was the middle seat in the last row for all her flights, I removed her known traveler number in the system so she wouldn‚Äôt get precheck, I booked her hotel at the lowest cost hotel in the system so usually a Motel 6 or Howard Johnson even though Hiltons and Marriott were within the cap, and on occasion I booked her rental car at an offsite location that didn‚Äôt have a shuttle to it. She‚Äôd come back from her trip upset and complaining about how bad it was. How bad the hotel was. Her seat on the plane and how she wasn‚Äôt precheck even though she‚Äôs military. She never figured it out it was me."}

I tried to stick only to known facts and fan response. Any speculation is kept to a minimum, and clearly labeled as such. **What is Critical Role?** Critical Role is a group of nerdy-ass voice actors who sit around and play Dungeons and Dragons. The group started off as friends, all of whom were professional voice actors. It'd take way too long to list all of their [roles](https://critrole.com/membertype/cast-members/), but suffice to say that if you've ever watched an anime dub, or played a AAA videogame, odds are you've heard at least one of them. The group got together to play a D&amp;D session for Liam O'Brien's birthday, and enjoyed it so much they started a long running campaign (for non-TTRPG people, a campaign is a number of sessions with the same characters, working towards bigger goals). In 2015, Geek and Sundry producer Felicia Day heard about the game and approached the group about streaming it as part of Geek and Sundry's content. They agreed, and the first stream exploded. It was a perfect storm situation: Geek culture was becoming mainstream at the same time as D&amp;D was experiencing a resurgence in pop culture with the simplified fifth edition. Combine that with a group of professional actors, writers, and comedians, and a near total lack of competing D&amp;D streams, and Geek and Sundry had a hit. The show exploded, and has been going steady ever since, eventually separating from Geek and Sundry to become their own company. They're currently on their third campaign, and have produced a successful animated TV adaptation (doing so through a record breaking $11,300,000 kickstarter), several books, multiple comics, and an official partnership with Wizards of the Coast to make official D&amp;D content. A [Twitch leak](https://www.wepc.com/news/twitch-leaks-critical-role-earnings-payout/) revealed Critical Role to be one of the highest grossing streamers on the platform, making over three million a year from the stream alone. They also kicked off a Renaissance of other D&amp;D streams, with everyone and their grandmother deciding that they'd be the next CR. A niche market with a handful of streamers became a massive genre, with thousands of options. In most other writeups on this sub, this would be the point where I reveal that the cast are secretly Nazis/domestic abusers/scammers, but... (so far), that hasn't happened. They started a charity organization and have donated frequently; they're generally friendly and down to earth with fans; they use their position of power to advertise lesser known content creators; they've made an increasing point of including diversity both in their fantasy world and staff. The only major cast drama occurred very early on when Orion Acaba got kicked out (read u/GoneRampant's [writeup](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/q5c2xf/web_media_critical_role_and_orion_acaba_how_to/) for more), and even that was handled quietly and maturely. While drama absolutely happens, it's almost always with the fans, not the cast. Honestly, it's more than a little freaky how non-dickish they are. However, as you may have guessed by the sub, drama did come. Not for the main cast, but for one of their friends and employees: Brian Foster. **Who is Brian Foster?** Brian had begun dating cast member Ashley Johnson back in 2012. In 2016, after the show had taken off, Brian appeared on an episode [to announce his new show](https://youtu.be/Qz-twLRAE_A?t=315), Talks Machina, a weekly recap where he'd chat with some cast members, show off fan art and cosplay, and answer fan questions. The show became popular pretty fast: fans got extra content and a look behind the scenes, plus, Brian had good charisma and a rapport with the cast. Brian's role expanded as the show separated from Geek and Sundry. He continued making Talks Machina (which woul"}

This rumor started due to a [White House Fact Sheet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-ensures-national-security-and-economic-resilience-through-section-232-actions-on-processed-critical-minerals-and-derivative-products/) posted late yesterday which states, ‚ÄúChina faces *up to* a 245% tariff on imports to the United States as a result of its retaliatory actions.‚Äù Many folks (myself included) initially assumed that this was effectively a new executive order that piled an extra 100% on top of existing tariffs. But that is not the case. A few days ago the [New York Times shared](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/12/business/economy/china-tariff-product-costs.html) a helpful summary that describes the range of tariffs for goods coming from China. Notably, syringes and needles have a tariff rate of 245% currently because they already had a pre-existing tariff of 100% before this trade war began. **Most goods (including board games) are still at 145%** (which is significantly lower but obviously still painful). [NYT Article](https://preview.redd.it/8eurjmz0aave1.png?width=1036&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0c0ecd0a99003c8db9180f2cf10b8f259b94df3) And here is a [USA Today article](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/04/16/trump-china-tariff-245-percent-trade-war/83114710007/) from today talking about the confusion. # Can‚Äôt publishers just manufacture board games outside of China to avoid these tariffs? This has already been covered quite extensively by other sources, so I‚Äôll stick to the short answer here: Most publishers cannot. The US has bare-bones infrastructure/ability to produce board games as we know them. It would take years of investment to catch up to China‚Äôs capabilities, and the result would still be much more expensive than manufacturing in China with these tariffs. **China is by far the global leader in board game manufacturing, and that will not change over night.** # Even with a 145% tariff, are publishers toast? That depends on a lot of factors: **Sales model (retail vs direct)** Publishers who rely heavily on retail sales will be hurt the most. With the cost of producing a game more than doubling (in the US), that means that the MSRP should nearly double to maintain the same margins. This is because publishers sell their games wholesale (to retailers and distributors) at a significant percentage discount (roughly 50-65% off) so that it is also profitable for those sellers. But a $30 game suddenly selling for $60 isn‚Äôt going to go very far in the market. So do publishers only increase prices a bit and eat the remaining losses? It‚Äôs a tough situation to be in. Conversely, a publisher who sells their games direct to customers is not taking nearly as big of a hit. Where a $6 game may now cost $15 due to tariffs, the publisher would only have to increase their selling price by $9 (instead of $30) to maintain the same margins. **Sources of Income** Publishers with international localization, digital apps, popular merchandise (not made in China), and other sources of income outside of Chinese-made products will be able to fare the tariffs better. **Regional sales (US vs International)** Fortunately the cost to sell games outside of the US has not increased. So publishers who have more international sales avenues will be hurt less. It seems that m"}

AKA ‚ÄúBasketball isn‚Äôt played on a spreadsheet!‚Äù (V3.0) (Reposting with mods‚Äô permission after making a change. This was the top post a couple of weeks ago but was removed and I‚Äôve updated the post accordingly) &gt;\"Basketball isn't played on a spreadsheet!\" &gt;&gt;Well, what if it was? 2 years ago (during the 2023 offseason), I made a post breaking down how the basketball simulation website WhatIfSports values NBA players in a fictional league where every player in history is available, using a 5-year window of players‚Äô careers. &amp;nbsp; I posted an update not long ago, but a regular season of our biggest league just finished so I‚Äôm updating this with new findings and thoughts. &amp;nbsp; **The site:** WhatIfSports is a site that takes every season of every player ever, and lets you build team with those player seasons. It then runs their real-life advanced per-possession numbers through an engine to imagine what would happen with all players from your team + your opponents‚Äô teams on the court, and generates a new box score and stats (all the way down to every single possession and timeout) #Part 1 of the update: My original post got 532 comments. Let‚Äôs start this post with what I learned from those comments, and what I feel needs to be emphasized: *Role players*: this isn‚Äôt like a traditional best players of all-time ranking that typically measures who is the best at being ‚Äúthe guy.‚Äù We‚Äôre making complete teams and there‚Äôs only one basketball. Example: if you already have Steph Curry, Paul Pierce, James Worthy, and Patrick Ewing‚Ä¶then Chet Holmgren will help you out a LOT more than Paolo Banchero. Due to the makeup of an ALL-TIME PLAYER POOL, every team can easily have 8+ players who were great at being ‚Äúthe guy,‚Äù but there are only so many elite role players from NBA history to go around. Since this involves team building, and there‚Äôs an ABUNDANCE of high usage all-star wings in NBA history and only a limited amount of DPOY caliber players who are elite rebounders: the elite role players get a boost. Supply and demand. Yes it looks funny that Ben Wallace gets picked ahead of Kobe Bryant, but A) even though Ben is a low usage player, the things he‚Äôs good at are harder to come by, and B) you can get a good scoring SG like Alex English or Devin Booker with your last pick if you want, but the late round defensive centers aren‚Äôt nearly as good. The delta between Kobe and a 12th round scoring wing is less than between Ben Wallace and a 12th round role players center, which would be like‚Ä¶Oliver Miller. &amp;nbsp; *Normalization:* The game uses per-possession stats (AST%, USG%, etc), which does a pretty good job of normalizing by era/pace. &amp;nbsp; *Average players*: The ‚ÄúMendoza/Andy Dalton bar‚Äù is a lot higher: In a real world single season environment (real life), a replacement player is someone like Javonte Green. But when you‚Äôre putting EVERY player in history together, the replacement level guys are LaMelo Balls and Vlade Divacs. The 50th best guy in today‚Äôs NBA would be a borderline G-Leaguer if every player from history came through in a time machine. But guys who can rack up non-scoring stats without needing the ball will always have a home here. &amp;nbsp; *Pure stats:* The game doesn‚Äôt say ‚Äúwell ___ would have learned how to shoot 3s if they played today‚Äù. They added some imaginary 3s, blocks, and steals for players who played before the 3-point line/before those numbers were tracked, and honestly they‚Äôre pretty generous about it. But that‚Äôs it. This is just straight up stat comparison and in an environment where team building is the key. And players from 1994-97 who got to play with a shortened 3 point line benefit heavily since their stats are being compared to players who play with the normal 3-point line if anything. &amp;nbsp; *‚ÄúInvisible stats‚Äù:* TO%: This is huge for us and I NEVER see it brought up irl.

Here's the video (and transcript). This was at the Nudgestock 2017, a behavioural science conference hosted by Rory Sutherland, at which Dominic Cummings was a speaker. **Rory:** I mean, there is an ethical question about the bus. The promise to the NHS. Was that a promise you were really warranted to make? **Cummings**: So the issue about the bus and the NHS. One of the myths about that is that it was sort of... invented by us and we never had any intention of doing it. But what I thought would happen is that, if we won, Cameron would be finished and Osbourne would be finished and there would be a leadership campaign. I then thought that Boris was a shoe-in to win. But then, of course, \\[...\\] Boris didn't end up going in. But we had talked about this in private before the vote and actually on the day of victory in the Vote Leave office. So, when Boris came in on the Friday 24th and punched the air and whatnot, he and I walked into this little room amid, sort of, beer cans and craziness. And I said to him \"first thing you do is say '*we're going to meet this promise.'*\" and he smashed his fist down on the table and said '*absolutely, no question about it'.* And, if Boris had \\[...\\] run as leader, I am 99.9 recurr- I'm as sure as I can be about pretty much anything that Boris would have said '*I will honour the promises that we made in this campaign*.' Because him and Michael \\[Gove\\] were very aware of what they'd said, and they were aware of the dangers of being seen to go back on it. And also, they also had the view that um... what are the core problems of the Tory Party brand, going back decades? The NHS. And people think - by the way, and I think those people are right - '*the Tory Party is run by people who basically don't care about people like me*' right? That's what most people in the country have thought about the Tory Party for decades. I know a lot of Tory MPs, and I'm sad to say the public is basically correct. Tory MPs largely do not care about these poorer people. They don't care about the NHS. And the public kind of has cottoned on to that.

There are some big developments, both character-wise, and overarching story-wise, and we learn a few details about a number of people in First Platoon. Episode 21 will be a jump to some new characters, some of whom might show up later in the story, some who might not.

Oh my goodness, it's something to watch. To watch him in the gym is a whole different thing. How much he makes everybody better, but also how he raises everybody‚Äôs level of play. His basketball IQ and his leadership ability. * Pelinka said that Jeanie Buss asked what the notable trait of this team is, and he said that it's their competitiveness, and that having a multitude of those guys has an exponentiation positive impact. * Rob Pelinka on the Lakers they‚Äôve been watching throughout the summer: ‚ÄúThis group of guys is as competitive as you can imagine ‚Ä¶ and Luke as the leader and coach is an ultra-competitive guy. He‚Äôs a fiery competitor. The gene of being a competitive individual is something that gets multiplied almost like compound interest when you have competitive guys in the gym.\" * Magic says that he hasn't been this excited in a long time. Says they brought in guys who have won championships in LeBron, Rondo, &amp; McGee, which he says is what the young guys needed. Not just vets, but vets with that type of experience. Magic says LeBron is \"already in midseason form. You're sitting there thinking, man, glad we signed him.\" * Magic: ‚ÄúRondo will help Lonzo go to another level...we got the right mentor.‚Äù * Pelinka noted how Magic, Rondo and Lonzo sat down to watch a Lakers-Pelicans game from last season. Rondo took them through what he was seeing on the court, and then Lonzo weighed in. Magic , ‚Äúthe best PG to play the game‚Äù oversaw it. * Magic says that whoever gets the rebound this year - they're gone. They want to run despite LeBron's history of playing on slower teams than how the Lakers played last year. But said it's ultimately up to Luke. \"We don't want his usage to be high. We're gonna run. We're not looking for one player.\" - Magic on team's offensive identity with LeBron. Magic said that plenty of other players could initiate offense with the ball (mentions Rondo, Lonzo, Ingram). Magic is really empowering Luke in this press conference. Magic adds that Luke is already been scheming how to implement LeBron and the rest of the new guys. * Rob Pelinka: \"If you use a sports car analogy, we wanted this team to have a lot of engine thrust, and not just from one player. You can go down our list. We have playmakers and guys that can get it, and not just come at you, but come at you with force.\" * Magic: \"We built this team off what we saw in the playoffs.\" * Magic says they're \"very happy\" with the center position, feels like they have 2 guys at every position. Singles out JaVale's ability to block shots, and how they haven't had a guy like that here for a while. Notes his lob ability on pick &amp; rolls too. Pelinka notes that they don't even talk about \"center\" and \"point guard\" and positions like that anymore. They look at it through a positionless lens. Magic also named Beasley playing some five. Pelinka mentioned 7 or 8 guys are 6‚Äô8\"-9‚Äù and above. * Magic Johnson said Kyle Kuzma got mad he was left off a top-100 list: \"I'm glad so he can keep working hard,\" Johnson said. Magic singles out KCP &amp; Kuzma as looking like \"totally different guys\" from a physical standpoint. * ROB IS TELLING A STORY: Rob Pelinka begins, \"I don't know if it's an ancient tale of old...\" and proceeds to compare Kuzma to a kitten running around the jungle, mimicking a lion, but not understanding what it means to be king of the jungle until seeing a real lion at work. LeBron is the lion. The point being that having champions around shows young guys how to be that for real, even if they thought that's what they were doing before."}

His murder is still unsolved. Disclaimer: If you're easily distressed, please *do not* listen to the 911 call below. It's seriously heartbreaking and bone-chilling in equal measures. **What happened that day?** Thursday, 12 December 1996, was a cold and rainy day in Moffat, a small hamlet outside Guelph, Ontario, Canada. 21-year-old Justin Greavette was on his way to fill up his truck when he checked the family's letterbox. There were some mails, and a package addressed to his father, [Wayne Greavette](https://imgur.com/a/eE5TlI0). Justin gave the package to Wayne when he returned home. Wayne opened the package. Inside were some newspaper flyers used as packing material, a letter, and a flashlight. Justin tried to turn on the flashlight as Wayne read the letter, but nothing happened. Justin then handed the flashlight to Wayne, who tried to turn it on while sitting on the sofa. This time, something did happen. When Wayne pressed the button, the flashlight [exploded](https://imgur.com/a/ku6tTWj) in his hands. Justin, who was sitting next to him, alongside Wayne's wife Diane, who was in the same room when the blast happened, were showered by shrapnels, but fortunately, both only suffered minor injuries. Justin immediately [called 911](https://youtu.be/15H1YJ4\\_HkA?t=331), frantically telling the operator, \"There‚Äôs a bomb, and my dad just blew up!‚Äù By the time emergency services arrived at the Greavettes residence, there was little they could do to save Wayne‚Äôs life. He had died almost instantly. ----- **Who was Wayne Greavette?** 42-year-old Wayne Greavette had worked in the beverage packing industry for most of his life. He met his future wife, Diane, when they were 15. They got married when Diane was 17 and had two children, Danielle and Justin Greavette. At the time of his death, he and Diane were preparing to establish a spring water bottling facility in their sprawling Moffat farm. Wayne was mechanically gifted, and he took care of the facility's machinery while Diane worked on the logistics. ----- **The Evidence** This section will be divided into three parts, each talking about relevant evidence, in this case, namely the package box, the flashlight bomb, and the letter. **The Package** The package was wrapped in [wrapping paper](https://imgur.com/a/InI9PR9), white on the outside and hunter green on the inside. Inside was a box labelled [Domaine D‚Äôor Cabarnet](https://imgur.com/a/wPiQreh), which used to hold a bottle of red wine. At the top of the box, a rectangular hole had been neatly cut off. Investigators suspected that this was to remove the barcode and UPC which could be used to trace the wine to where it was purchased. Apart from the flashlight and the letter (which we'll get into in a moment), several flyers were used to pack the wine box. Most of these flyers were widely circulated in Southern Ontario. However, one stood out: a [flyer](https://imgur.com/a/zNQMzqj) advertising Copeland Lumber, a building centre located at [700 Main Street East, Milton](https://www.google.com/maps/place/700+Main+St+E,+Milton,+ON+L9T+3P6,+Canada/@43.5232805,-79.8737849,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x882b6f062d116fb5:0x2fc1b58b77f391fb!8m2!3d43.5232766!4d-79.8715962), around 20 km from Moffat (that address is now a Habitat for Humanity ReStore location) and was only distributed around the Milton area, which would suggest that the mailer might be local to the area. Two strands of hairs were recovered from the debris. They did not have their roots attached, and as a result, no nuclear DNA profile could be generated. The Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) enlisted the help of the FBI to generate a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) profile, but this has not resulted in any progress.

What you miss is the streamlined clarity that made the original such a pleasure. **2/5** Odie Henderson, Boston Globe - I enjoyed the animated version of this movie quite a bit, so I‚Äôm torn between being happy this film was nowhere near as bad as I‚Äôd expected and being frustrated that I sat through a carbon copy. **2.5/4** Mark Kermode, Kermode and Mayo's Take (YouTube) - This is a really faithful \"live action\" reproduction of an animated film that has added nothing, but has taken away some of the magic of the animation. Kyle Smith, Wall Street Journal - Mr. DeBlois‚Äôs film harks back to the pre-‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù style of children‚Äôs moviemaking, when the condescension of oversimplification was a defining attribute. Aparita Bhandari, Globe and Mail - Toothless glistens, thankfully. Young audiences will be delighted... For the older folks, there‚Äôs the added subtext of a post-war commentary, and the whole us-versus-them narrative to unpack, that‚Äôs ever more relevant today. Michael O'Sullivan, Washington Post - ‚ÄúDragon‚Äù imparts these pearls of wisdom with verve and delight, in a telling that is as visually impressive as it is emotionally stirring. **3/4** Brandon Yu, New York Times - To be sure, this new iteration is entertaining, bears a sense of heart and brings a tight script of fantasy and friendship to life. Soren Andersen, Seattle Times - It‚Äôs what the moviegoing experience should be about, but rarely is. Grand, glorious and fast on its feet. **4/4** Bob Mondello, NPR - Toothless is as charismatic as ever; the flying sequences and natural landscapes are appropriately breathtaking, and if the film is overly enamored of lesser dragons belching fire at incoherently bellowing Norsemen, well, so was the original. Matt Singer, ScreenCrush - Plays like cinematic d√©j√† vu. **5/10** Amy Nicholson, Los Angeles Times - How to train your dragon? As we learned back in 2010, it takes patience and fish. Why train your dragon again? That‚Äôs harder for filmmaker Dean DeBlois to answer. Peter Howell, Toronto Star - Is writer-director Dean DeBlois being consistent or just lazy? The question should keep him awake nights, staring at the dark sky in search of fresh dragons and wondering why he can‚Äôt do better than the cartoons he commanded earlier. **2/4** David Fear, Rolling Stone - What this movie is actually trying to accomplish, beyond a shadow of a doubt, is how to train their audiences to keep buying the same thing over, and over, and over again. Maureen Lee Lenker, Entertainment Weekly - In that regard, the film is every bit as earnest, captivating, and thrilling as its animated twin.

It happened on Monday Morning. A 17 year old British Citizen: Axel Muganwa Rudakubana walked into a Taylor Swift themed dance class for children in Southport. He then began attacking the children and their parents with a knife. Stabbing multiple. He then fled the scene but was arrested by police later that day. As of now we know that multiple children were stabbed and so were two adults, 3 of the children have died while 5 others currently remain in critical condition. The two adults are also reported as being critically ill. While we now know the identity and background of the attacker, due to reporting laws in the UK until a judge had ruled to release his name, no one knew who he was at the time and no one could report on it. A couple of hours after the attack and in a vacuum of information, what were believed to be AI/Bot news accounts on X started publishing false information on the identity of the attacker. A quote from one of the accounts (@channel3now): ‚Äú17-year-old Ali Al-Shakati from Banks has been arrested in connection with the Southport stabbings and is currently in police custody. Ali-Al-Shakati, was on the MI6 watch list and known to Liverpool mental health services‚Ä¶ He was an asylum seeker who arrived in the UK by boat last year.‚Äù This report was then picked up by right wing online personalities and ‚Äúalternative media‚Äù journalists who hadn‚Äôt bothered to verify the validity of the claims or the reliability of the source (all of which had history of fabricating stories and facts for breaking news). Article on this: https://amp.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/jul/30/misinformation-southport-attack-suspect-social-media-conspiracy-theories Following this, the day after the attack (Tuesday 1st August) a vigil for the victims was held by the community while others from within the community and outside of it led a protest outside of a local mosque which then turned violent. At this point there were calls to action from right wing online personalities and political figures, mostly along the lines of stopping illegal migration and the migration of Muslims into the country. Again at this point the identity of the killer still wasn‚Äôt known and multiple far right groups arranged protests in multiple cities under the slogan: ‚ÄúEnough is enough‚Äù. On Thursday 4th August a judge ruled to release the Killer‚Äôs identity following a hearing on the grounds that since the killer was 18 in a few months and that this case was of significant public interest following the night of violence on Tuesday and the level of misinformation. The ruling revealed the name of the killer and we now know that he was ne"}

I decidedly *don't* love talking about Star Wars on the Internet, mostly because I find it a chore to keep straight which parts I'm *allowed* to love and which parts I'm *supposed* to hate. It's no way to enjoy something, of course, but such is the nature of \"being a fan\" in the 21st century. Nevertheless, the sad thing is that I can't seem to help but do it anyway, which is why I'm making this post (having threatened to do several times in various Hobby Scuffle threads) in which I have written five and a half thousand words about decade-old Star Wars fan drama that many people may have forgotten about, if they even knew it existed in the first place. But maybe you will enjoy reading about it. **A Long Time Ago...** This is a story about the Star Wars Expanded Universe. I anticipate that most of the folks reading this will know what that was: the great mass of novels, comics, games, cartoons and more which took place in the fictional world of Star Wars, revealing \"what happened next\" for the protagonists of the movies, exploring its ancient history (a dark time in which the Jedi are hunted by the resurgent Sith Empire) and far(ish) future (a dark time in which the Jedi are hunted by the resurgent Sith Empire) and explaining how the extra with the ice cream machine who appears on screen for about three seconds in *The Empire Strike Back* was *actually* a Rebel sympathiser and the ice cream machine was *actually* a computer memory core containing sensitive information which he was trying to hide before the Empire could completely take over Cloud City. When George Lucas sold Lucasfilm and Star Wars with it to the Walt Disney Company, the Expanded Universe found itsef in limbo for a couple of years until Disney confirmed that all Star Wars stories produced prior to its acquisition other than the six movies and the *Clone Wars* computer-animated series (in other words, the things in which George Lucas himself had taken an active and direct hand in creating, writing, producing and directing) would be rebranded as \"Legends\" and would not form part of the larger fictional story of Star Wars going forward. My recollection is that most fans were more disappointed than angry. Of course, some people absolutely *were* angry, some of them very, very, *very* angry, and many of those angry folks are *still* angry today, but I imagine most people had realised that this was an inevitable outcome from the moment the sale and acquisition was announced. The Expanded Universe was now \"non-canon\". However, I think the picture is a little more complex than that. I'm going to try to explain why. **Star Wars and \"canon\"** Oh, good grief. What a can of worms. This is a really easy topic to get bogged down in and its almost certainly going to happen here, but I think it's pretty important to the overall story, so I'll wade through it. My understanding has always been that \"canon\" in Star Wars prior to the sale of Lucasfilm to Disney vaguely operated on a kind of tiered system. At the highest level, you had \"G\" canon, which was anything George Lucas himself had taken an active and direct hand in creating, writing, producing and directing. This encompassed the movies, obviously, but also ~~flippant off-the-cuff remarks~~ ex cathedra pronouncements such as Obi-Wan's home planet being called \"**Stewjon**\", which Lucas \"revealed\" in an incredibly obvious dad joke when he was asked during an interview with **Jon Stew**art at a convention in 2010 (for the record, this is still \"canon\" - we shall see if it comes up in the Disney Plus series soon enough). The lower levels of \"canon\" encompassed essentially everything that was licensed; in other words, everything Star Wars that George Lucas had no input on. This material was counted as \"canon\" to the extent that it did not contradict anything at the George Lucas level and, in some c"}

Smells like a luxury department store in Dubai where they sprayed too much perfume. After I tested it, I found out that Sofia Vergara uses this one, and I can see that! She's a super strong presence, immaculately dressed, superior human. I, on the other hand, am a little work-from-home goblin, whose daily battles are \"does tomato sauce leave a permanent stain?\" and \"is it too late to start watching Game of Thrones?\". So, I'll pass on this one. **Boyfriend's opinion:** Damn, so intense. Heavy. **Final Score:** 2 / 5 **Armani Prive - Th√© Yulong** So I bought the full bottle already. Zero self-control. It's such a relaxing, fresh, aromatic, citrusy tea. This is one I can totally see expensive luxury spas using. Or fancy boutique hotels. As you read through these reviews, you'll discover my life's mission is to smell like an overpriced establishment. Th√© Yulong gets me closer to that goal. It also lasts decently on my skin and clothes. **Boyfriend's opinion:** \"Mmmm what's in this, lemon? Orange? This is so nice, I like it a lot.\" Since I bought the full bottle, he's actually been requesting \"the one that looks like a butt plug\" because he loves the smell so much ü•π **Final Score:** 5 / 5 **Armani Prive - Vert Malachite** Smooth, slightly sweet, creamy white floral with a touch of vanilla. It's very floral and delicate, ultra-feminine. It's not really for me‚ÄîI do wish the bitter orange came through more. Then I think it might be a contender for me. You really don‚Äôt need much of this; I imagine it will get too much if over-sprayed. Performance is great on this, so a bottle will last a long time. **Final Score: 3.8 / 5** **Armani Prive - Noir Kogane** This smells like a leathery ashtray and it stays in your nose for eternity like a clingy ex. That's it, that's the review. **Boyfriend's opinion:** \"It really does smell like an ashtray.\" Validation üòå **Final Score:** 1 / 5 **Byredo - Gypsy Water** It's very chic clean girl. At first it's citrus, sandalwoody, aromatic. Out of all the Byredo's I tried, this one has the worst performance on me. On dry down it becomes a slightly sweetened vanilla skin scent. Overall cute, but nothing more. Not worth the weak performance or getting a full bottle. There are other Byredo perfumes I much prefer to this. **Final Score: 3.5 / 5** **Byredo - Bal d'Afrique** Immediately yes. Love at first smell. This is really my taste. Aromatic, woody citrus perfection. Woody, floral, fresh, citrus, aromatic, this perfume could cater to lovers of all of these. It smells expensive, like a luxurious spa. I always look for a spa scent, just like I always look for more tea scents. To me, it's unique. Very bright, the wood grounds it and I LOVE that there is a touch of musk in here. I love that it smells natural. It really smells like you just got out of a very expensive hotel shower. It's year-round in my opinion, signature-worthy. The lasting power was also decent! I could wear this all the time. **Boyfriend's opinion:** Lovely!! **Final Score: 5 / 5** **Byredo - Mojave Ghost** Something about this reminds me of skincare or fancy shampoo, in a good way. I think it deserves the hype. It has a fresh airy quality, but the sapodilla fruit used in it makes it a bit more interesting. I think Bal d'Afrique is overall better, but I go back and forth between them. This is another fresh out the shower type of perfume, but in a more girly and fruity floral way. I wish it had better longevity on me, but maybe with a proper sprayer on clothes, it would suffice. **Boyfriend's opinion:** Also lovely!! I think I prefer this one over Bal d'Afrique, but they're both amazing. **Final Score: 4 / 5** **Byredo - Mojave Ghost Absolu** This one is expectedly an enhanced version of the OG. Performance is great! Somewhat musky, some woodiness and floral. However, it's stronger and more 'dense' than the OG (makes sense, 'absolu' being "}

And then some teams are just lame weather reports (Heat, Suns, Thunder), while others are entertainment industry advertisements (Magic, Raptors, 76ers). And then there are all dum animal names that are completely interchangeable. The point is each franchise has to move and not just swap names but take their entire organization with them, players and all. Judging criteria is simple: * Clearly a better fitting name for the city. * Should be inspirational for what the city wants to be perceived as. * Or, let‚Äôs be honest, most of these will not make any sense at all. I‚Äôm just chasing a perfect loop here. Let‚Äôs start this one off with 2020 Champs: Lakers! - **LAKERS**. Sure, it would make sense to send this team back to Minnesota where they have more lakes than black people, but there is another place where ‚Äúlake‚Äù is literally in their official city motto. ‚ÄúMistake by the Lake‚Äù **CLEVELAND LAKERS**(sorry Bron) - **CAVALIERS**. This team name is a weird reference to a bunch of US presidents being born in Ohio. But when we think of Ohio, do we think of failed rust belt cities, unemployment and poverty, urban decay, opioid crisis, or do we think of the POTUS? Come on! **WASHINGTON CAVALIERS** - **WIZARDS**. The whole nerd lore of wizards and spells and trolls and magic is of European origin dating back to illiterate medieval surfs being afraid of wooded areas. Make up your own fables US! New Orleans voodoo? Now that‚Äôs some proper spicy home brewed shit! **NEW ORLEANS WIZARDS** - **PELICANS**. Sure, that‚Äôs Louisiana‚Äôs state bird, but these flying rodents are all over the gulf region. And some of the Louisiana ones are brown but lots of them are white as toilet paper. That‚Äôs not very NBA. You have to go east to find the true urban pelicans-of-color: **MIAMI PELICANS** - **HEAT** Vikings intentionally swapped names of Greenland and Iceland in a brilliant real estate marketing ploy. It didn‚Äôt work out of course, but maybe it worked on just enough ‚Äòright‚Äô people. Toronto doesn‚Äôt need to fool all players into thinking Toronto is not literally located on the north pole. Just enough of them to fill a roster that is not an all-scrubs-team. Also Toronto actually does have really beautiful summers. All 6 weeks of them! **TORONTO HEAT** - **RAPTORS**. Dinosaurs have always been a major point of contention for all western religions. Their existence really spoil the plot of ‚ÄúTHE GOD‚Äù S1E 1. When Mormons ended up settling in what is now modern day Utah, they ended up in a region with one of the richest fossil deposits in the world. Look to the ground and dinosaur bones everywhere! So, what is LDS Church‚Äôs take on dinos? ‚ÄúUhh it is not important that they existed or not uhh like, that‚Äôs not the main plotline anyways, can we talk about something else?‚Äù lol **UTAH RAPTORS** - **JAZZ** Jazz originates in New Orleans, no doubt about that one. But! Jazz is such a quintessential American style of music that spread like wildfire across the nation. LA-Chicago-NYC. Truly the original hip hop where you didn‚Äôt need no words to cuss at the world. But it was Chicago Daily Tribune who first ever coined the word Jazz back in 1915. Also, best Jazz I have personally seen was in Chicago. Makes all other Jazz sound like Drake. **CHICAGO JAZZ** - **BULLS** If I was literally a bull, I would probably move to Wall Street NY where they already have a statue of me. Or just maybe, move to a place that has a lot of cows. Apparently Texas has 11 million cows. That is more cows than human population of 43 individual US states. And if I was a bull moving to Texas, I would probably go where all The Cowboys are. That place must have a lot of big juicy cows **DALLAS BULLS** - **MAVERICKS** The only Maverick I know of is former US senator from A"}

The Acolyte bombed. Outlaws is looking like a failure. The Rey show is MIA. Rian Johnson‚Äôs trilogy is MIA. Almost everything in modern Star Wars is a failure. Years and years of being told, as a fan, that the franchise was no longer for me, that my criticisms stemmed from racism/sexism, that I was a bigot, a phobe, a Nazi. My criticisms were never about women in Star Wars. It just so happens that most of the women in Disney Star Wars are poorly written, and I‚Äôd address the same criticisms at the male characters they fucked up too. Luke, Obi Wan, Darth Vader, Boba Fett?? All destroyed. All I‚Äôve been saying, since the word go, is that I want the characters to be treated with respect, to have obstacles, to show some actual fucking growth, a reason to be invested. Apparently that makes me every nasty thing under the sun. Because Disney‚Äôs tried so hard to push women, when they can‚Äôt write women that are appealing to anybody, except the women who write them. Well, to those who pushed to have Star Wars the way it is now; how‚Äôs that going for you? To be inundated with mediocre product after mediocre product. Flop after flop after flop. The brand is a laughing stock. You had *an open world Star Wars game, something people have been clamouring for for decades* and it sold like shit. You can‚Äôt hide behind your activism anymore; this shit is *not appealing to anybody*. The numbers are loud and clear. We are not the minority. We were right. You were wrong.

Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine could be described as a watershed moment in modern history, a turning point comparable in importance to the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, and even to the outbreak and resulting international reshuffle of WW2. Whether this ominous view of the war turns out to be justified, only time, and future historians, will tell. But there‚Äôs no doubt that in the violent, tumultuous days after February 24th, the established international order has been shaken and, in some respects, upended in extraordinary, unexpected and often unwelcome ways. And quite possibly purposefully so. It was not very long before this war, that the nations of Russia and China put out quite an interesting [statement](https://china.usc.edu/russia-china-joint-statement-international-relations-february-4-2022) *just three weeks before the invasion,* about a new cooperation towards the goal of creating a \"new era\" in the world, a new order dominated not by western hegemony but by themselves. A full breakdown of that statement can be found [here.](https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2022/02/12/breaking-down-that-putin-xi-joint-statement-on-a-new-era/) Three weeks? The statement was made February 4th 2022, and the invasion of Ukraine began on the 24th, not even three weeks later. Coincidence? Happenstance? I think not. The conflict in Ukraine will become the catalyst of a new world order, a trigger for radical upheaval. It has created a bombshell on the world stage that could create a new global geopolitical battle, and result in a much-altered future for us all. In trying to find meaning behind the sudden press of Vladimir Putin's drive for Ukraine, most people are coming up empty in the \"why\" column. There are, of course, plenty of reasons stated in the propaganda of both sides, some of which sound pretty good, but all of them fail when one looks at the bigger picture. Because they all assume this is about Ukraine, and only about Ukraine. Nato encroachment, the defence of russian-speaking people, desires to reclaim ancestral lands, fears of being cut off, all of these sound okay. Sorta. But the reality is that none of those reasons are worth the consequences of what we have been seeing unfold. Anyone here ever play Monopoly? What is the least fun position? It is that of the player who, early in the game, realizes that he is already doomed. The dice did not go in his favor one too many times, and he knows that, as the board stands, he has no chance of winning at all. It happens, and the other players still have lots of fun, because they are still really competing with each other, while the loser grows bored and upset. The operative phrase in that statement is \"as the board stands.\" But what if there was an accident? Oh no! I spilled my dinner plate across the board! The dog just jumped on everything! That guy got his peanut butter all over my chocolate! Now what? Dang, looks like we all have to start over. And that losing player, well, now he is back in the game. A very simplified analogy, but relevant. Because I believe that this entire thing has very little to do with taking over Ukraine, a very large nation which Russia knows it would be very hard pressed to occupy and govern permanently. What I think is that this is just an opening gambit in a much larger operation to destabilize the western hegemony, send the global economy into a crisis, and rewrite the global security architecture away from the currently imposed system of rules-based order and closer to the way things were when wars of conquest were more common. When might made right. A coordinated campaign to bring the world into a state of chaos and war, crashing economies, disrupting food supplies, hampering trade, and in general making a huge mess that can only be cleaned up one way... Upsetting the game board, as it were, helps put everyone closer to a level playing field again. Russia was never going to win. "}

With Rhodes and The Bucks signed to ROH (as well as other talents who are on ‚ÄúAll In‚Äù being signed to appear), it doesn‚Äôt take a genius to guess that ROH has a vested interest in the show, or else they wouldn‚Äôt allow their talents to be doing a show on their own at this level. How much of that interest exists, however, will likely not ever get revealed‚Ä¶at least, not anytime soon. &gt;Bullet Club, through the nature of its origins as an anti-hero, renegade group has marched to its own drum since its inception. That personality was what sold the group, but over time, the wrestling became secondary and the personalities involved sold the group ‚Äì and made it so popular that Hot Topic came to them about carrying shirts nationally. You can debate how much Bullet Club means to the average pro wrestling fan, but if you are a discerning one who watches more than the WWE Network, they move the needle for you. &gt;What is both amazing and scary all at once is that Bullet Club has morphed into the modern-day equivalent of what the NWO used to be for World Championship Wrestling ‚Äì the company asset that has grown so large and so hot, it‚Äôs at the point of outshining the mothership. Remember when Scott Hall used to do the survey and ask who the fans were here to see, and most nights, the villainous NWO was more over? That‚Äôs Bullet Club today. &gt;Bullet Club has grown so hot, but at the same time, have become so embedded in the ROH DNA, that by the week, they become all that more important to the long-term viability of ROH. While certainly the company could hire other talents, the loss of this crop would lead to the company losing so much ground and goodwill at once, it‚Äôs impossible to measure. &gt;After all, Cody and the Bucks just became the top independent draws in all professional wrestling ‚Äì with the gate receipts to prove it. Certainly, there are others involved here who helped move tickets, including Kenny Omega, but the stamp of the show was Bullet Club as seen through the prism of that trio. Cody left WWE because he didn‚Äôt want to be a supporting player in their stories. The Bucks have pushed their independence and developed themselves as new school heels who put their thumb in the eye of every wrestling convention and tradition. Their latest accomplishment not only lifted them all to the next level, but it pushed them beyond the box that is ROH. &gt;ROH drew a thousand or so in Chicago tonight. All In sold 10,000 tickets without the traditional ROH branding. The show also sold double the amount of tickets New Japan has moved thus far during their recent American excursions. Those companies are seen as corporations, as companies. Bullet Club are seen as the cool garage band you love to support, only now they are making money without selling out to the man. &gt;\"All In\", its presentation and it's success rests on the marketing and creative building the show, which lands on the shoulders of several talents who collectively, on this date, mean more than the promotions they are contracted to.

AKA ‚ÄúBasketball isn‚Äôt played on a spreadsheet!‚Äù (UPDATED for 24-25) *\"Basketball isn't played on a spreadsheet!\" Well, what if it was?* &amp;nbsp; 2 years ago, I made a Reddit post where I broke down how the basketball simulation website WhatIfSports values NBA players in a **fictional league** where **every player from history is available**, in a league that uses a 5-year window of a player‚Äôs career where new games are simulated. A brief explanation of WhatIfSports is that it takes every season of every player ever, and lets you build team with those player seasons. It then runs their real-life advanced per-possession numbers through an engine to imagine what would happen with all players from your team + your opponents‚Äô teams on the court, and generates a new box score and stats (all the way down to every single possession and timeout) &amp;nbsp; My original post 2 years ago got 532 comments. Some of them had good points and thoughts, so let‚Äôs start this post with what I learned from those comments, and what I feel needs to be explained better this time: - The biggest disconnect from the original post‚Äôs comments seems to be that people didn‚Äôt understand that this isn‚Äôt like a traditional best players of all-time ranking that typically measures who is the best at being ‚Äúthe guy.‚Äù We‚Äôre making complete teams and there‚Äôs only one basketball. Due to the makeup of an ALL-TIME PLAYER POOL, every team can easily have 8+ players who were great at being ‚Äúthe guy,‚Äù but there are only so many elite role players from NBA history to go around. Since this involves team building, and there are an absolute ABUNDANCE of high usage all-star wings in NBA history, but only a limited amount of DPOY caliber players who are elite rebounders: the elite role players get a boost to their stock. Simple supply and demand. Yes it looks funny that Ben Wallace gets picked ahead of Kobe Bryant, but A) even though Ben is a low usage player, the things he‚Äôs good at are harder to come by, and B) you can get a good scoring SG like Alex English or Devin Booker with your last pick if you want, but the late round defensive centers aren‚Äôt nearly as good. The delta between Kobe and a 12th round scoring wing is less than between Ben Wallace and a 12th round role players center, which would be like‚Ä¶Oliver Miller. Again, supply and demand. - The game uses per-possession stats (AST%, USG%, etc), which does a pretty good job of normalizing by era/pace. I explained this in the last post but I really want to emphasize it again. - In this world, guys who are real life all-stars by being slightly above average for a high amount of minutes aren‚Äôt as valuable as they would be in real life. With 12 draft picks and only needing to fill 48 minutes for 5 positions, you‚Äôre better off platooning two great low-minute guys like Manu Ginobili plus Jimmy Butler together (Butler plays less minutes per season than you‚Äôd realize) than you would be with a high minute borderline all-star like DeMar DeRozan alone, since Manu and Butler both have far better per-possession stats. (Also, a player being slightly above average in a normal NBA season would be below average in a world that includes every player ever. The 50th best guy in today‚Äôs NBA would be a borderline G-Leaguer if every player from history came through in a time machine). - The game doesn‚Äôt say ‚Äúwell ___ would have learned how to shoot 3s if they played today‚Äù like humans say. They added some imaginary 3s and blocks and steals for players who played before the 3-point line or before those numbers were tracked, and honestly they‚Äôre pretty generous about it to some of those guys. But that‚Äôs it. This is just straight up stat comparison and in an environment where team building is the key. And honestly the players from 1994-97 who got to play with a shortened 3 point line benefit heavily since their stats are being compared to players who play with the no"}

Enjoy! *** **1. NBA Basketball 101** **2. Positions &amp; Player Types** **3. A Brief History of the NBA** **4. Team-by-Team Breakdowns** *** #**1. NBA Basketball 101** **Scoring ‚ÄòBaskets‚Äô.** Putting the ball through the hoop either awards you 1, 2, or 3 points depending on the circumstance. 2-point shots are the most common, and the default for any shot, lay-up, or dunk. The shot is worth 3-points if it enters the basket from beyond the aptly-named 3-point line, also called ‚Äòthe arc‚Äô (e.g. ‚Äòfrom beyond the arc‚Äô or ‚Äòfrom downtown‚Äô). Common types of standard shots include the ‚Äòjump shot‚Äô, when a player‚Äôs feet leave the ground as the ball leaves his hands, and the ‚Äòstep back‚Äô, when a player quickly steps backwards, away from the defender just before shooting. The only 1-point baskets are free throws ‚Äì open, uncontested shots awarded to players who have been fouled, or whose team has amassed a certain number of fouls in a quarter. **Fouls &amp; Violations.** The penalties of the NBA come in a wide variety of obscure forms, but the ones you‚Äôre going to see the most are: ‚Ä¢ Personal Fouls ‚Äì When an opposing player hits, pushes, shoves, holds, or illegally obstructs another player. If the fouled player was shooting the ball, and the ball went in, they‚Äôre awarded one free throw (i.e. they get 2 points for the basket, or 3 if it was a 3-pointer, and have an opportunity to make it a 3-point or 4-point play, respectively, by scoring a free-throw). If the fouled player was shooting the ball while fouled and missed, they are awarded either 2 free throws for a missed 2-pointer, or 3 free throws for a missed 3-pointer. ‚Ä¢ Charging ‚Äì You can‚Äôt plow into a defending player. ‚Ä¢ Blocking ‚Äì You can‚Äôt plow into an offensive player. ‚Ä¢ Traveling ‚Äì You can‚Äôt move while holding the ball and not dribbling it. ‚Ä¢ Carrying ‚Äì You can‚Äôt hold the ball from underneath between dribbles. ‚Ä¢ Goaltending ‚Äì Imagine a shot ball as traveling in an arc through the air. Once it reaches the apex of that arc and begins to fall downward toward the basket, it can no longer be blocked, or touched, by any player. ‚Ä¢ 3-Second Violation ‚Äì In general, you cannot stand in the ‚Äòkey‚Äô or ‚Äòlane‚Äô ‚Äì the painted rectangle just under the basket ‚Äì for more than 3 seconds. There are a variety of exceptions, but in general this prevents a player from standing under the basket for a substantial period of time. There are others that are less common and less important. Understand that many of these fouls and violations are, to some degree, subjective, and that the referees who determine whether they‚Äôve taken place are imperfect. Mistakes are made. Calls are made that shouldn‚Äôt have been, and calls aren‚Äôt made that should‚Äôve been. It‚Äôs part of the game. Get used to it. **Assists.** Assists are a stat awarded to players who pass the ball to a player who then promptly scores. This stat reflects a player‚Äôs passing ability, their unselfishness, and their ‚Äòvision‚Äô ‚Äì their ability to know where other players are on the court and to get the ball to them at the right time to guaran"}

This organization has bullied the Texans enough. Controversial opinion, but go ‚ÄòStros! Time to prepare for *another* big test in Green Bay on Thursday night. 2. | [](/TB) | Buccaneers | -- | 6-1 | If Brady kryptonite Nick Foles had started, it may have led to a different outcome, but the Bucs picked up an overwhelmingly one-sided 38-3 victory over the Chicago Bears. Though Brady threw for 4 TD's, the defense was the real star of the show, notching 4 sacks, 3 forced fumbles (with 3 recoveries), and an additional 3 INT's. The takeaways for the defense should serve as a fine practice for next week's matchup against the New Orleans Saints, where Jameis is likely to use the Bucs' DB's as an extra set of WR's. 3. | [](/LAR) | Rams | -1 | 6-1 | Unlike Jared Goff, this win was ugly. The Lions wanted to win bigly and got off to a hot start, emptying out the bag of tricks early in the form of fake punts and an onside kick. Slow starts to both halves from the Rams kept the score close until the 4th quarter when they finally pulled away. Despite a decent looking box score, the Rams never really felt right: they were unprepared on special teams and failed the eye test defensively at times (yet again). So far, a porous looking defense hasn‚Äôt been a big storyline with the focus on the magic between Stafford and Kupp. Maybe it‚Äôs high expectations or finding things to nitpick about a 6-1 team, but there‚Äôs a small sense that despite solid defensive metrics on paper, this will be an issue at some point unless buttoned down. Derrick Henry in week 9 looms large. Until then, the Rams are massive favorites against Houston next week. 4. | [](/BUF) | Bills | +1 | 4-2 | [The Bills checking up on the AFC after their bye week like](https://gfycat.com/faroffcarelessjackal) 5. | [](/DAL) | Cowboys | +2 | 5-1 | Collins is back from suspension, five IR/PUP guys are in their practice windows, and Dak seems to be good to go for Sunday night. As good as this team has been so far, they weren't even at full strength. Things are looking up. 6. | [](/GB) | Packers | -- | 6-1 | The defense finally got a red zone stop! The Packers limited Washington to 3 points in four red zone trips! De'Vondre Campbell is really flashing the proverbial leather here, Even with allowing Taylor Heinicke to run wild they kept the points off the board. Sure we might get obliterated by the Cardinals in two days, but hey Aaron's done more with less in Arizona before 7. | [](/CIN) | Bengals | **+5** | 5-2 | All is good in Bengals world right now. The Joe Burrow to Ja'Marr Chase connection looks unstoppable and the rebuilt Bengals defense was able to beat the Ravens for the first time in the Lamar Jackson era. The only thing between the Bengals and a 6-2 record right now is a visit with their old friend Joe Flacco. 8. | [](/TEN) | Titans | +1 | 5-2 | The Titans seemed to have great execution on their game plan going in the first half of the week 7 game against the Chiefs. At halftime the Titans held a 27-0 lead, held the ball for 23:16 and ended every drive with a score. The Chiefs were held to 5 drives in the first half ending in 2 turnovers, 2 punts and the end of the half. This was the first time since week 9 of 2020 that the Titans won a game when D"}
{"brand": "Johnson & Johnson", "archetype": "Caregiver", "source": "reddit", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1livmxi/religion_was_never_out_of_us_politics_trump_just/", "text": "Religion Was Never Out of U.S. Politics. Trump Just Took Off the Mask. Theocracy doesn‚Äôt need a declaration, just enough loopholes and someone ruthless enough to use them. Trump didn‚Äôt invent theocracy in America, but he ruthlessly exploited centuries-old religious loopholes to build a system where loyalty to him and to religious ideology now overrides law and democratic norms. Let‚Äôs start with education. For well over a century, American public funds have bled into religious education, from Bible-led ‚Äúcommon schools‚Äù in the 1800s to modern-day voucher systems. But landmark Supreme Court rulings like Carson v. Makin and Espinoza v. Montana made it explicit: states can‚Äôt exclude religious schools from taxpayer-funded voucher programs. What did Trump do? He supercharged this by championing school choice, funnelling billions into religious schools with no requirement for secular curriculum, no accountability for science standards, civic education, or civil rights protections. Why it matters: This isn‚Äôt just about money. It builds a loyal, ideologically aligned base, generation after generation, educated under religious nationalism and isolated from democratic values. ‚Äî Then there‚Äôs the Johnson Amendment, which once barred churches from endorsing candidates. In 2017, Trump signed an executive order telling the IRS to stop enforcing it. Why it matters: Now, pastors and religious leaders can openly campaign for Trump from the pulpit, and still keep their tax-exempt status. He transformed churches into campaign arms, immune from regulation and fueled by congregants‚Äô trust. ‚Äî Through RFRA (Religious Freedom Restoration Act), Trump expanded religious exemptions in federally funded services: adoption agencies, hospitals, welfare programs. Faith-based groups could now legally deny services to LGBTQ+ people, non-Christians, and the non-religious. Why it matters: These aren‚Äôt private charities, they‚Äôre publicly funded. But now they act as gatekeepers of morality, enforcing Christian nationalist values and excluding anyone who doesn‚Äôt conform. That‚Äôs not public service. That‚Äôs belief-based governance. ‚Äî Inside the White House, Trump has established a religious command center: * White House Faith Office led by televangelist Paula White-Cain, acting as a direct liaison between religious leaders and executive policy. * Task Force on Anti-Christian Bias, chaired by Attorney General Pamela Bondi, designed to investigate federal agencies accused of discriminating against Christians. * Religious Liberty Commission, chaired by Dan Patrick and vice-chaired by Ben Carson, coordinating religious policy across multiple agencies. Why it matters: These are not ceremonial roles. They embed religious ideology into the federal government, bypassing legislative debate and enforcing morality through executive power. ‚Äî The Victimhood Strategy: Weaponizing Christian Identity A core tactic in this system is reframing dominance as persecution. Trump and his allies now treat American Christians (who still hold vast cultural and institutional power) as a threatened group. The Task Force on Anti-Christian Bias, for example, isn‚Äôt just symbolic. It empowers the federal government to investigate educators, media, and civil servants accused of undermining ‚Äútraditional values.‚Äù The language of persecution becomes a tool to reshape institutions. Why it matters: It flips the logic of civil rights. Instead of protecting vulnerable groups from discrimination, the state now protects dominant religious ideologies from criticism. It redefines equality as oppression, and dissent as hostility to faith. ‚Äî Then came the branding strategy. Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúGod Bless the USA Bible,‚Äù sold at rallies, positioned his campaign as sacred duty. Evangelicals described him as chosen by God. Supporting him became not political, but spiritual. When voter loyalty begins with religious obedience, elected power becomes unaccountable power. Why it matters: He reframed democratic accountability as heresy."}

Hello Reddit and basketball enthusiasts! *Disclaimer: This is a long post and will go through editing and improvements. There was much consideration when determining the tiers and which players belonged where. Players chosen were weighted towards the modern era with some exceptions. I tried to have a nice balance between eras of players as well as a balance of play styles at each price point.* **Update 12/4:** I won't make any edits at this time, but I am considering moving Klay Thompson up to $800. He is one of the best shooters to ever play and a high level defender. If you have any other suggestions or changes, please let me know and they will be considered. Great response so far! I'll check back tomorrow. **In this exercise, the goal is to draft your ultimate NBA team using a limited amount of $ available. Each player has a price tag so you will have to think carefully about how you choose your players. The idea is to build the best team that you can. Think about how players would play together and compliment each other.** Rules: * You have $6,400 in total to spend on your team. * Players range from $1,300 to $600. * The average price of your players will be $800. * All players are considered in their prime and healthy. * There are 8 slots on your team. PG/SG/SF/PF/C and 3 UTIL. * You must have at least one of each position. UTIL players can be any position. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- To determine the players available, I utilized the following resources: ESPN's All-Time #NBArank Top 100: http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/page/nbarankalltime/greatest-players-ever (Full List Here: http://www.interbasket.net/news/19115/2016/02/the-full-list-of-espns-100-nbas-greatest-players-of-all-time-nbarank/) Bleacher Report All-Time Top 25 (By Position): PG: http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2223084-br-nba-legends-100-ranking-the-greatest-point-guards-of-all-time SG: http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2222903-br-nba-legends-100-ranking-the-greatest-shooting-guards-of-all-time SF: http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2218871-br-nba-legends-100-ranking-the-greatest-small-forwards-of-all-time PF: http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2215220-br-nba-legends-100-ranking-the-greatest-power-forwards-of-all-time C: http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2200009-br-nba-legends-100-ranking-the-greatest-centers-of-all-time -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- After considering these lists, I added a number of today's players as well. I tried to also include specific roles at various price points and skill levels (shooters, defenders, specialists). The best teams will likely have key utility players that help bring everything together. **For your reference, here are the tiers as they currently stand. The tiers loosely follow the ESPN All-Time NBA Rank lists. It was important to come up with these tiers before considering position so that players of relatively equal skill were in the same price ranges.** **$1,300:** Michael Jordan **$1,200:** Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell, Tim Duncan, Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal, Hakeem Olajuwon **$1,100:** Oscar Robinson, Julius Erving, Jerry West, Moses Malone, Karl Malone, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, David Robinson, Dwayne Wade, Kevin Garnett **$1,000:** Dirk Nowitzki, Charles Barkley, John Stockton, Isiah Thomas, Scottie Pippen, Chris Paul, Steve Nash, Kevin McHale, Patrick Ewing, Jason Kidd, Clyde Drexler, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Gary Payton, Ray Allen, Kawhi Leonard, Dwight Howard **$900:** James Worthy, Dominque Wilkins, Paul Pierce, Reggie Miller, Tony Parker, Paul George, Robert Parish, Tracy McGrady, Kyrie Irving, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Davis, Allen Iverson, Dennis Rodman, Dikembe Mutombo, Derrick Rose **$8"}

Because of the expensive electricity and the water caused by the oligarchs, political corruption, &amp; the unfair land share of the 40:60 rule (just to safeguard the oligarchs), here is a list of multinational-branded products that are no longer made in the Philippines: * **Colgate-Palmolive products (Colgate, Palmolive, Tender Care, Irish Spring, etc)**. Their Makati factory began manufacturing their products in 1951, according to the already deleted YT video dedicated to Colgate-Palmolive Phils. Inc. (CPPI). On August 8, 2008; CPPI closed their plant due to high water &amp; electrical costs. Their plant is torn down to give way for a luxury condo called the Proscenium, owned by the same oligarch man that owned MERALCO. Snobbish hypocrite. CPPI wanted to return their production in the Philippines, but they need to wait for the utilities to lower their consumption costs. As of now, CPPI have to import their products mostly from China and Thailand. Colgate toothpastes are imported from China &amp; Thailand, Colgate Plax mouthwash is from Thailand, Colgate toothbrushes are from China (like most countries like the US imports), toiletries under the brands Palmolive, Tender Care, &amp; Irish Spring are also imported from Thailand. Ajax &amp; Axion cleaners are imported from Malaysia. CP's rival Unilever only makes toothpastes in sachets only while the tubes are from Indonesia and Vietnam. The only Pinoy-made toothpaste in the Philippine market are Hapee (Lamoiyan), Unique (ACS), Personal Collection (PC), and Avon (made by Lamoiyan under license). Look. Don't get me wrong. I loved the toothpaste of Colgate &amp; Unique. Two months after the closure of CPPI Makati plant, my mom and I, with my classmates at Montessori school, went to the Lamoiyan plant in Paranaque during my field trip back in grade 2 of 2008. * **SC Johnson products (Baygon, Glade, Pledge, etc).** Also at Makati City, SC Johnson's plant is just closer to the CPPI plant. They also closed down &amp; later demolished due to the same reason. Although, SC Johnson's aerosol products like Baygon, Raid, &amp; Glade used to be made at Aero-Pack (part of D&amp;L company) in Quezon City. In 2009, they closed down their plant, leaving only the 3 Indonesian &amp; 1 Vietnamese plant operational. Some SC Johnson products (mostly Pledge, Mr. Muscle, &amp; Baygon liquid &amp; chalk) are made by Multimix in Cabuyao, Laguna; while some (mostly Off &amp; Kiwi) are made by Telstar in Santa Rosa, Laguna. However, unfortunately, the Mr. Muscle spray bottles for kitchen, bathroom, &amp; glass, were transferred from Multimix Cabuyao to Cyberpax in Thailand due to their better quality. Those Pinoy-made Mr. Muscle sprays were exported to Malaysia &amp; Singapore, but due to a few poor reviews I saw (on Lazada MY &amp; SG, Shopee MY &amp; SG, &amp; Amazon SG), SC Johnson transferred those sprays (except for the mold and mildew killer spray on the same old bottle) from Cabuyao to Thailand. At least it is closer for Thailand to export to Malaysia and Singapore. The toilet bowl cleaner bottles under the brands Duck &amp; Mr. Muscle are mostly made in Vietnam. Remember Baygon spray cans being Pinoy-made? SCJ transferred them to China until 2024, which is now made in Thailand. SCJ in Thailand, Indonesia, &amp; Vietnam makes those spray cans while the PH, MY, &amp; SG imports them. Lucky. The only Pinoy-made insect sprays are the locals Kwik, Gecko, &amp; Target. * **Johnson &amp; Johnson products**. J&amp;J used to make their products like Johnson's baby products (shampoo, lotion, oil, powder). They even made Listerine. Nowadays, most of J&amp;J products are imported from Thailand &amp; Malaysia. J&amp;J Malaysia makes toiletries (shampoo, lotion, soap, etc) babies except baby powder and baby oil, while J&amp;J Thailand makes baby powder, baby oil, Listerine mouthwash &amp; Modess panty liners. The only Pinoy-mage J&a"}

While not pretty at times, the Birds found a route to victory behind another stellar performance by Jalen Hurts, and 93 yards plus a touchdown on the ground courtesy of Miles Sanders.

That seems to be the theme of Titans games recently. In a game where the Chiefs running backs had no juice, Patrick Mahomes was asked to will the Chiefs to a win. With a career high 68 attempts on the night, he did just that. Shoutout to the Chiefs defense as well, who stifled the Titans in the second half. The young unit is playing above expectations which is key for the Chiefs if they wanna make a deep playoff run. | 3. | [](/BUF) | Bills | -2 | 6-2 | Well, it seems like the Bills are due for a game like this every year. They looked rough, and the Jets looked like a team that‚Äôs really on the upswing ‚Äîespecially on defense. The Bills D was getting pounded on the ground, hampered by an All-Pro injured list. Meanwhile the offense pissed away opportunity after opportunity, hurt by some poor decision making by Allen, some unbalanced playcalling, and an O-line that couldn‚Äôt keep the pressure off the QB all day‚Ä¶.oh, and if that wasn‚Äôt enough, Josh Allen might have injured his UCL.

Meanwhile Vikings legend Za'Darius Smith leads the NFL in pressures and is second in sacks despite a bye week, and the Vikings' secondary held the Commies to just 4.1 net yards per attempt even after a [wild zebra stampede turned an easy interception into a 49-yard touchdown](https://twitter.com/MarkBullockNFL/status/1589342006257635328).

You're the Baron Gottfried van Swieten to my Mozart, and I appreciate it. Also added Dvorak, Chopin, and Rachmaninoff by popular demand. Lots of pianists in /r/nba, I see. *** Nobody will care about this, and I am perfectly fine with that. On a thread yesterday, some people (me, /u/W360, /u/gudbjartur) got to talking about classical composers and their NBA comparisons. I‚Äôm bored at work, so I figured‚Ä¶why not. I should note that I‚Äôm no scholar of classical music. There are tons of people who know more about it than I do. I‚Äôm just a guy who likes classical music and pro basketball. Basically, I wanted to stay mostly chronologically correct. I roughly matched up the eras of the NBA into the different epochs of what is more correctly known as Western concert music. The '40s and '50s are roughly matched up with the Renaissance era, the '60s are Late Renaissance and Early Baroque, the '70s are Late Baroque, the '80s are Classical, the '90s and early '00s are Romantic, and the late '00s and '10s are everything since: Impressionist, Contemporary, Modernist, Post-Modernist. However, just like eras in music overlap, certain basketball players may not be neatly sorted into chronological order. *** ## Renaissance Era __Guillaume Du Fay__: Regarded as the leading composer in mid-15th century Europe. Du Fay was prolific in the forms of the time: masses, motets, and other liturgical work. He was one of the first to utilize the newer harmonic structures of the early Renaissance period, and is widely considered the first truly Renaissance composer, much like __George Mikan__ is considered the first star of the NBA. __Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina__: an Italian renaissance composer, he left hundreds of compositions in his wake. He is one of the most influential composers in terms of style, even if people nowadays don't know it; kind of like how __Bob Cousy__ still has a huge influence on point guards despite the casual NBA fan not knowing who he is. __Claudio Monteverdi__: Widely regarded as the first Baroque composer, he was proficient in both Renaissance polyphony and Baroque _basso continuo_. He composed one of the first operas and is considered a revolutionary composer. He was influential in his time and pioneered a whole new style of composing, similar to how __Bill Russell__'s Celtics teams pioneered a new brand of up-tempo basketball. __Giovanni Gabrieli__: Represented the culmination of the Venetian school of Late Renaissance music. He was the organist at Saint Mark's Basilica, the most prestigious post in Venice at the time. His style underwent a change to a more modern style upon hearing Monteverdi's work. __Wilt Chamberlain__ had to make stylistic changes as well in order to beat Russell's Celtics. *** ## Baroque Era __Heinrich Sch√ºtz__: Considered one of the greatest German composers ever, Sch√ºtz wrote the first German opera, had a huge number of pupils, studied with Gabrieli, and was a great aggregator of talent during his 50-odd years in Dresden. __Jerry West__ certainly is no stranger to the creation of super-teams, both as a player (the Wilt-West-Baylor Lakers) and as an executive. __Alessandro Scarlatti__: an extremely prolific Neapolitan composer of operas and cantatas. He fathered two other famous composers, Domenico and Pietro Fillipo, and he moved around a lot, perpetually unhappy with his posts, similar to how __Rick Barry__ fathered two NBA players, Brent and Jon, but quickly wore out his welcome with most of his teams. __Johann Pachelbel__: Enjoyed great fame and popularity and composed a huge body of work. However, most people today know him only for Canon in D, like many NBA fans know __Walt Frazier__ as the rhyming commentator with the crazy suits, not the championship point guard for the Knicks. __Georg Philipp Telemann__: One of the most prolific composers in history. Compared favorably to Bach, even though Bach had mo"}

The CFP? For Rutgers, I‚Äôd say our most likely path to a bowl is winning our first four games, all of which will be at home (Ohio, Miami-OH, Norfolk State, and Iowa), then beating Purdue on the road and Maryland at home later on. I know we‚Äôre facing the MACs best, but Schiano usually starts the season strong and takes care of non-conference, and without Kaleb Johnson, Iowas offense may go back to normal levels. Purdue is going to be a program in transition, and we beat Maryland soundly on the road last year, a lot of the guys from that game are back this year. I‚Äôd say we have a 70% chance at being bowl eligible. The CFP? It‚Äôs a 1% if not 0.1% chance, but if it did happen, since we have a weak non-con and aren‚Äôt a big brand, we probably have to go 10-2. So add wins @ Minnesota, @ Washington, vs Oregon, and @ Illinois. The 2 Ls would be @ Ohio State and vs Penn State. Despite going 13-0 before the CFP, I still think Oregon‚Äôs floor and consistency as a program are lower than OSU and PSU. They lose a lot of production, and even last year they came close to dropping some games they really shouldn‚Äôt have. What about your team?"}

I would not share it, if I did not think there were certainly potential considerations. **Why would you care?** If you are a content creator and part of the [OpenDND.game](https://OpenDND.game) movement, you may wish to consider this strategy. **Risk?** The risk in this strategy is time. I do not perceive any downsides, other than it may not work. However, if you do not try - you never know. I share this from my own insight, knowledge, and experience. Wall Street works on perception and window dressing of expectations. Facts are less important than shareholder perception. Perception drives stock price. To win, you need to play the same game that Hasbro does. It's all about money, hit them where it hurts the most and they pay attention, and changes are made. This is how it works in the world of public companies and Wall Street. Understand how to play the game and you may have a fighting chance for change to the OGL. \\------------------------------------ # Hasbro is the adversary Hasbro is a public company, thus to create a proper strategy to defeat OGL 1.1, a plan needs to assess and understand how Hasbro thinks and what Hasbro values. Hasbro number one value is the share price and meeting shareholder expectations to drive the price higher, pay dividends, and for the execs/board to get their bonuses (and keep their jobs). They do not care about D&amp;D for what it is, but how it translates to shareholder value and stock price. Period - the end. **Who makes decisions?** Hasbro decision-making is done by the executives that run the company (Execs, C-Suite). They have a board of directors to whom they report and help steer the direction of the company. If the board of directors thinks the execs are not doing a good job, they remove them and find new executives. The relationship between the board and execs can oftentimes be incestuous as they may have quarterly, or annual bonuses based on performance. However, sometimes, with one or more large shareholders (activist investors) the board can remove execs and change the course of the company. **How are decisions made?** The Execs and Board look at one thing and one thing only, Quarterly Results (3-month period on how the company is doing and how it is expected to do next quarter). Their Quarterly Results are the core drivers in the market perception which ultimately drives the stock price. **The Quarterly Game.** First ‚Äì Wall Street analysts (people at major institution firms that monitor the company financials, news, and other information) set a ‚ÄúQuarterly Expectation‚Äù for the company and this may include ‚ÄúUpgrades‚Äù or ‚ÄúDowngrades‚Äù. The Quarterly Expectation is a discrete number based on the expected profit or loss per share. Downgrades and Upgrades are the analyst recommendation based on the set expectations. Is the company doing better or worse and will they meet the expectations analyst set. Second - the Execs and Board read these expectations and now the game begins. They will steer the company‚Äôs decisions in an attempt to beat the expectation. If they can beat the expectation, they win (probably get bonuses) and help the stock price go up. If they fail, they do not get bonuses and the stock price goes down. This process rinses and repeats every quarter. * Hasbro reports the FY 2022 Earnings on February 6th, 2023 * Hasbro‚Äôs following quarterly report is on April 24th, 2023 (1st Quarter). **Influencers** Hasbro has three groups of influencers in its decision-making. 1. Analysts from Wall Street cover the company and set expectations. 2. Financial News outlets that report news and set perceptions of Hasbro, which can influence "}

A lot of the drama that springs up here is very dense and emotion-driven, as well as being incomprehensible to most outsiders. I'm gonna try my best to keep the tangents and insider wrestling jargon to a minimum here, so feel free to comment about any parts you don't understand. I'm also recalling a ton of this from memory, so bear with me. **A Quick Glossary:** WWE - World Wrestling Entertainment, formerly the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). For the purposes of this post I may refer to WWE/WWF interchangeably. Kayfabe - wrestling lingo for \"in universe\", the overall masquerade that dictates all the onscreen action/drama is \"real\" and the wrestlers are the characters they're playing. Babyface - the \"good guy\" or hero in a story. Also called a \"Face\" for short. Heel - the \"bad guy\" or villain. Conventional wisdom in the industry often dictates that heels are more interesting characters than faces. Because wrestling. Heel turn - a good guy turns evil and becomes a heel. Despite the above conventional wisdom, this is *not* always a good thing. Face turn - a bad guy turns good and becomes a babyface. Smark - shorthand for a hardcore wrestling fan, for the purposes of this post. A portmanteau of \"smart mark\", which has elaborate carny roots I won't go into here. #Introduction The central conceit of professional wrestling is guys doing a mostly-convincing performance of beating each other up, often against the backdrop of a wider feud or narrative spanning months or even years at a time. Think MMA, but less boring and with soap opera dramatics. And like any other soap opera, wrestling had its designated heroes (babyfaces) and villains (heels). Let's get one thing out of the way: WWE is the biggest wrestling company in the world, and you'll be hard-pressed to find a wrestling fan who hasn't heard of some version of it. WWE is also synonymous with wrestling itself to most (but not all) lay people across the world. WWE's biggest storylines play out on one of two weekly TV programs: Monday Night Raw, and Smackdown Live. (WWE's third major weekly show, NXT, is a whole other messy story that merits an entire post of its own.) WWE also has monthly pay-per-view shows - think Wrestlemania or the Royal Rumble - which often serve as the \"climax\" to a given short- or long-term feud. There are generally three types of viewer attitudes towards the overall brand: * Type 1: casual fans (\"marks\") who believe **WWE is the center of the wrestling universe**; * Type 2: more \"involved\" hardcore fans (\"smarks\") who know that **WWE is just one wrestling company out of many**, each with its own style and ethos. However, due to the nature of wrestling and the [controversial history](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_WWE) of how WWE became the industry leader in the first place, there is significant overlap between Type 2 and * Type 3: **WWE is evil**, in the classic \"Big Bad Monopolistic Multimillion-Dollar Corporation\" sense that embodied everything wrong with capitalism. So... what does all of this have to do with Roman Reigns? #The WWE Ideal There are certain \"fan myths\" that have been built around wrestling over the years, WWE in particular. Some are more true than others. A common one is that WWE has terrible storylines, and that they're incompetent at writing babyfaces. One of the most pervasive myths (of many) however revolves around Vince McMahon, WWE's longtime CEO (and occasional onscreen villain) who also had the final say in most canonical feuds and storylines behind the scenes. According to most smarks, Vince McMahon is a size queen. Which is to say he favors \"larger than life\" wrestlers built like bodybuilders with a bombastic personality to match. Think Hulk Hogan or The Rock or John Cena: they're the epitome of Vince's d"}
