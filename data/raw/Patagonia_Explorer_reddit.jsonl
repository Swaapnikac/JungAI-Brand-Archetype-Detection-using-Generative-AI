Since then, I've worn it basically every single day, taken it to multiple continents and even to risky events like protests. It's been the best backpack I've had, very practical, sturdy and reliable. But it was unavoidable that it would start showing some signs of wear after a few years, especially the handle stitching ended up half torn (though the handle was still usable). Yesterday, when I randomly came accross a Patagonia store, I figured I would test the so-called lifetime warranty of Patagonia's gear. I went to the teller with my backpack, showed the stitching damage and asked if this would be covered under their warranty program. I was expecting a long and annoying process proof of purchase verification and online forms, but the salesperson just said they would replace the whole bag since this exact model had received an upgrade to a newer generation. So I ended up walking out with a brand new improved backpack, without paying a dime or providing a single receipt. Honestly, I'm still in awe. Patagonia stuff is expensive that's for sure, but I just got a new backpack free of charge that will probably last me for years. I would've been fine with just a quick stitching fix (and it would've been the most eco-friendly solution), but I really like this level of commitment towards their clients. Let's just hope my old backpack will be properly recycled while I enjoy this new one !"}

Think of this list as “high end but for normal people”. I think that the mid-priced tier is a good compromise between price, fashion, and quality. Brands on this list will generally be higher quality than the mall brands; they typically use higher end materials (mostly natural fibers, except for the technical garments which use high performance synthetics). Many of them are made in first world countries with better labor and sustainability practices. I organized the brands into various categories and provided the country that each brand is based (not necessarily where they are made). I also show price tiers for each of them relative to their category. Keep in mind this is just my opinion. I left off footwear (which would be a pretty extensive list too) and accessories. 395 brands is already so many! Feel free to ask about the brands or offer any critique or comments! I do not own pieces from every single one of these brands, but collectively, people here can relay their experiences and opinions.

So does anyone know what the full story is with the Lost Arrow Project? The entire thing is extremely vague and shady. From my understanding Lost Arrow Corporation was the holding company for Patagonia and all it's ventures and investments. But no longer is as of the last couple of years ?

The company’s image – they say they’re in business to save our home planet – is very different from fast-fashion brands like asos, Primark and Nike. But Patagonia’s clothes are manufactured in exactly the same factories and under the same deplorable conditions.** When Yvon Chouinard started creating climbing equipment in his parents’ backyard in Burbank, California, he used steel. Soon he earned a reputation for making the ‘best’ climbing equipment in America. But every time a climber slammed one of those steel pegs into a rock, the gap got a little bigger and eventually unusable. Chouinard realised he was making money by destroying the rocks and therefore also the sport. And so he switched to aluminium blocks, which did not damagethe rocks. The change was expensive and risky for the young company, but the moral dilemma was reason enough for Chouinard to implement the change. And to be very outspoken about it. It was a success: within a year, 40 per cent of the US climbing community stopped using steel. Chouinard applied this experience when he started the outdoor brand Patagonia in 1973. He wanted to make only high-quality clothing that would last. And limit the impact on the environment as much as possible. In 1996, the brand switched to 100 per cent organic cotton, only to increasingly replace it with recycled materials. But the responsibility that Chouinard attributed to the company extended further. In 2002 he decided to give one per cent of sales to environmental organisations every year. In 2011, Patagonia placed a full-page ad in the New York Times calling on consumers to ‘not buy this jacket’ in order to draw attention to the problematic nature of overconsumption in the clothing industry. In addition, the clothing had to be manufactured fairly: in 2012, the top of the company made paying living wages to everyone who makes Patagonia products a ‘priority’. In 2020, Patagonia launched a campaign encouraging consumers to demand more from clothing brands: ‘*Demand recycled. Demand organic. Demand Fair Trade,’* Patagonia urged its viewers. In 2022, the then 84-year-old Chouinard caused worldwide astonishment, when he gave away 98 per cent of his shares to a newly formed NGO, the Holdfast Collective, which is ‘committed in its fight against the environmental crisis and protecting nature.’ Henceforth, the company’s profits would no longer flow to himself or his children but to the climate. ‘Earth is now our only shareholder,’ Chouinard said. *Billionaire gives company away to climate*, newspapers like [*The New York Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/14/climate/patagonia-climate-philanthropy-chouinard.html;)*,* [*The Washington Post* ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2022/09/14/patagonia-yvon-chouinard-climate-change/)and [*The Guardian*](https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/sep/15/yvon-chouinard-the-existential-dirtbag-who-founded-and-gifted-patagonia) reported\\*.\\* This construction saved the NGO an estimated 700 million dollars that Chouinard would have had to pay in tax if he had sold the company and donated the proceeds to the same NGO. But according to Chouinard, this option allowed him to do something else: protect Patagonia’s values. Because he did not give the voting shares to Holdfast Collective but to a family trust. This allows his family to continue determining the company’s direction. The company’s turnover – its European headquarters are in Amsterdam − grew by more than 50 per cent that "}

Maybe Monos? I have a Monos front pocket one and have loved it so far. Been a lurker here and wanting to ask around. The thing I appreciate about Monos is they are part of 1% for the Planet and Climate Neutral certified. I recently learnt this from visiting their store in Vancouver. Always been a big fan of Patagonia, so love it when brands use these commitments as a part of their story telling and selling points. The store staff also told me they are working on their B-Corp application. The staff actually went on and told me how both 1% for the Planet and Climate Neutral worked. 1% Monos donates 1% of their revenue (not profits!) to different environmental organizations and climate neutral is by offsetting carbon emissions with donations. I was thinking to myself this is a lot of money. They also mentioned how its part of their operations as well, so in addition with using sustainable materials and all that, they look to reduce emissions and shipping as much as possible - eg: they would ask customers to not ship back items in certain cases to reduce the back and forth shipping and just give them a refund or an exchange. Haven't seen this personally yet, but anyone had that experience? I am wondering if there are any other luggage brands that does or talks about sustainability like this? Monos does seem like they are growing a lot and I've seen great reviews, but also a lot of negative ones, but seem to have great values at the core."}

We were nine days out from the Austin SaaS-summit demo when Derek—the new “strategic partnerships” guy with the permanent Bluetooth earpiece—noticed my watch during the 8 a.m. stand-up. It’s a Tissot PRX Powermatic 80: perfectly respectable, but hardly haute horology. Derek’s eyes locked on the waffle dial like it was a prize in a claw machine. “Nice PRX,” he said, rolling the acronym on his tongue like he’d just discovered it. “You know, first-impression optics matter. My Timex Weekender isn’t exactly closing six-figure deals. How about you let me rock yours for the summit? Team prosperity vibe, right?” I laughed. He didn’t. He followed up with a Slack DM: Derek K. — ‘Need the PRX 4 success ✌️. Let’s do a 24-hr loaner.’ Then he dropped a calendar invite titled “Watch Handoff | Mandatory.” I declined it. Politely. Escalation phase Tuesday He ambushed me at the coffee machine, explaining that since we’d be pitching Swiss VCs, a Swiss watch was, technically, a “client-alignment asset.” He offered collateral: his Patagonia vest—retail $129—and a verbal promise to “treat it like a newborn.” Wednesday He looped my manager in an email, cc’ing HR, implying that, by withholding the watch, I was “undermining unified brand presentation.” HR replied with a single-line policy reminder: “Personal property remains personal.” Full stop. Thursday Derek cornered me again: “Fine, but if we lose this deal because I couldn’t borrow a mid-tier watch, that’s on you.” The comeuppance We flew to Austin Sunday night. Monday morning, Derek strode into the hotel lobby puffed up with confidence—and, sure enough, a Tissot PRX gleaming on his wrist. Or something that wanted to be one: the seconds hand ticked instead of sweeping, the date window font was wrong, and the bracelet links were hollow enough to rattle. I raised an eyebrow. He smirked: “Amazon overnight. Saved your precious timepiece, buddy.” During the pitch, one of the Swiss VCs—turns out he collects mid-century Omegas—spotted the watch immediately. “Interesting PRX,” the VC said, pausing the slide deck. “May I?” Derek froze but extended his wrist. The VC flipped it over, revealing a blank caseback where the exhibition glass should’ve been. “Ah,” the VC nodded, “a creative interpretation.” You could feel the oxygen leave the room. Derek stumbled through the rest of the demo while the VC exchanged amused glances with his colleagues. We didn’t land the deal that day. Back at HQ, leadership decided Derek would “focus on internal enablement” for the foreseeable future—no client-facing travel. Apparently, misrepresenting both product specs and your wristwear in front of investors isn’t “on-brand.” Meanwhile, my genuine PRX stayed on my wrist, keeping steady 80-hour power reserve and an even steadier moral of the story: If you want credibility, don’t borrow (or fake) it—earn it."}

This question crossed my mind recently and I started doing some googling and I was surprised to learn that some of my favorite \"core\" brands are actually owned by giant investment firms or corporations. In general, as a lover of this sport, I want to support the smaller, rider owned and operated brands with my dollar when it comes time to buy new gear. Take Volcom for example. Volcom is a brand I always considered \"core\" and cool with a rad team, but they're actually owned by Authentic Brands, which [now owns the Boardriders](https://thedaily.outdoorretailer.com/news/brands-and-retailers/authentic-brands-closes-boardriders-acquisition/#:~:text=The%20New%20York%2Dbased%20brand,to%20a%20licensing%20operating%20model) group (Quicksilver, Roxy, DC, Billabong, plus a few others). This now puts Volcom and Quicksilver next to brands like David Beckham, Frye, Forever 21, Izod, Nautica, and Spyder. [Link to Authentic Brands' portfolio](https://corporate.authentic.com/brands) Another example, Mervin. I always thought of Lib and Gnu as rad, independent, rider owned brands but no. Apparently (according to [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mervin_Manufacturing#:~:text=Mervin%20was%20purchased%20by%20Quiksilver,was%20purchased%20by%20Altamont%20Capital)) they were bought by Quicksilver in the late 90s, and by Altamont Capital in 2014. Colored me surprised. I found this pretty funny, especially after T Ricky's That's it That's All part where the Lib logo is peeing on a Burton logo, when Burton is actually still privately owned. So final example is Burton, which I know is still privately owned. Say what you will about them being \"core\" or not, but I think the fact they've chosen to stay private is rad and a positive for our industry. I personally think they have deservedly lost a lot of respect from the community with various moves like buying up brands to drop them later, *cough* *Forum* *cough,* but they do continue to invest in putting out solid products and supporting rad riders. Anyways, I'm just wondering if anyone has a solid list of who is still privately (and ideally rider) owned in the snowboard industry. I managed to find a 12 yr old [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/snowboarding/comments/m4di1/snowboarding_who_owns_who_jpg/) that linked to a cool [info graphic](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Q5GWc46SESE/S118yx6JbgI/AAAAAAAAB3w/4qn2AchkQzg/s1600-h/Brand-Map.jpg) and I would love to see a current version of this.

An MBA’s Crisis of Conscience So, you’ve made it to r/mba. Congrats! You’re either part of, or want to join, an elite group destined to disrupt industries, optimize synergies, and leverage paradigms. But let’s have a quick chat, shall we? A little \"Are We the Baddies?\" moment for us MBAs. # Management Consulting: The Sharpest Tool in the Corporate Sociopath’s Toolkit You wanted to be a consultant. Who wouldn’t? Jet-setting around the world, charging $500 an hour to tell someone they need to “right-size” their workforce (which is just a fancy way of saying, \"fire a lot of people\"). But then there’s the *other* side of consulting. Like McKinsey, that time they decided to help Purdue Pharma flood the market with opioids. Or when they propped up dictators like a well-paid Instagram influencer. Who knew that “driving growth” and “optimizing value” could sometimes involve a body count? If you ever feel a chill while putting together a deck, it might just be the ghosts of ethical compromises past whispering, \"Are we the baddies?\" # Investment Banking: Making the World Go Round... Until It Doesn’t Investment banking, the dream job for those who find excitement in turning numbers into money, and money into... well, more money. Remember the 2008 financial crisis? Oh, you weren't there? Well, neither were most of us, but we’re all still paying for it. Literally. That “financial innovation” (read: mortgage-backed securities) left a few trillion dollars missing, like your socks after doing laundry in a shared apartment building. Oh, and don't forget the Savings and Loan Crisis of the '80s and '90s. It’s almost like the words \"banking\" and \"crisis\" go together like MBAs and Patagonia vests. # BigTech: Don’t Be Evil...ish Tech was supposed to save us, right? But then, we got Meta. And Amazon. And Google. And Apple. And Twitter. And TikTok. And all those lovely privacy invasions, misinformation campaigns, and worker exploitation. Remember when Google’s motto was “Don’t be evil”? Good times. Now it’s more like, “Don’t be evil... unless it’s profitable.” Or how about those nifty algorithms that decide what you see and think? They're just helping, right? Helping to destabilize democracies, encourage extremism, and maybe sell you a new toothbrush. You’ve got to admire the efficiency. # CPG Brand Management: Selling You the American Dream (and Diabetes) Brand management is where the real magic happens. You take a product like sugary cereal, slap a cartoon character on it, and suddenly kids are hooked for life. And by “hooked,” I mean “developing type 2 diabetes before they hit high school.” It’s all about creating lifelong customers, right? So what if their lifespan might be a little shorter? And let’s not forget the “greenwashing” efforts. Slapping “eco-friendly” on a product that’s wrapped in more plastic than a Marvel action figure isn’t fooling anyone... except, you know, consumers. # PE/VC/HF: Private Equity, Venture Capital, Hedge Funds—It’s All About “Efficiency” Ah, Private Equity. Buy a company, strip it for parts, load it up with debt, and watch it collapse like a Jenga tower with a few pieces missing. But hey, at least you get to walk away with a nice little bonus. Venture Capital? More like “Vulture Capital.” The odds of your portfolio startups succeeding are about the same as getting struck by lightning while holding a winning lottery ticket. But when one hits, you’re a genius! For the rest? Well, there’s always another entrepreneur willing to pivot their way into your checkbook. Hedge Funds? Just good old-fashioned gambling, but with other people’s money. “Heads I win, tails you lose” should be on the business card. # So... Are We the Baddies? Now, before you pull out that Patagonia vest and head to your ethics class (yes, they still make you take one), it’s worth asking: are we really the good guys? Sure, we’ve got the spreadsheets, the frameworks, the KPIs, and the slick PowerPoints. But at what cost? Maybe it’s"}

The threads I'm finding are a bit older, so I'd love to get a thread of all brands that are BIFL for women's shoes, clothes, outerwear, etc. I've found that even some brands that are BIFL for men don't last nearly as long in the women's versions (I'm guessing the increased stretch in women's clothing is one factor, and that women's clothing tends to be thinner.) And while I tend to dress like a 12 year old boy most of the time, sometimes I like having clothing that is better fitted and designed for my body, so I like to get women's specific clothing. *NOTE: I'm not vetting these brands any further, just listing the suggestions given. I'm hoping to come back in the future and do a more in-depth look at all the brands and make a more detailed list. Also, not all of these brands will work for everyone!

But then I thought: it wouldn’t be too much trouble to transcribe the whole horror story (it wasn’t) and see what holes there are. *Cat’s out of the bag. I’m shocked that we’ve kept this a secret for so long.* *In 2 weeks my show’s coming out, which I’m so excited for. And also my business, which I think there’s been a lot of curiosity about.* \\[Fake laughter.\\] *Last year, I’d thought: You know what? American Riviera - sounds like such a great name, it’s my neighbourhood, it’s a nickname for Santa Barbara. But it limited me to things that were just manufactured and grown in this area.* *Then Netflix came on, not just as my partner in the show but as my partner in my business. It was huge. I thought about it, and I’ve been waiting for a moment to share a name that I’d secured in 2022, and this is the moment. And it’s called As Ever. As Ever essentially means ‘as it’s always been’, and if you’ve followed me since 2014, with the Tig, you know I’ve always loved cooking and crafting and gardening. This is what I do, and I haven’t been able to share it with you the same way for the past few years, but now I can.* *So as things are starting to trickle out there, I wanted you to hear it from me first. Of course there’ll be fruit preserves - I think we’re all clear at this point that jam is my jam. But there’s so many more products that I just love that I use in my home, and now it’s time to share it with you. So I can’t wait for you to see it. Thanks, guys.* \\[NB Read above with exaggerated inflexion, breathiness, tones of awe and wonderment, faux coyness.\\] 1. **Quoth the maven, ‘ARO no more.’** How long has Meghan kept What Ever, I mean As Ever, a secret? Let’s look at a rough timeline: \\- 14 March 2024: ARO had a soft launch (never had, and never will know, a proper launch now), followed by a couple of uninteresting Instagram posts. From memory these coincided with Royal Family news. \\- Summer 2024: Meghan files a trademark application (seriously?). \\- August 2024: Application rejected due to many, many problems (from memory, all set out in a 37-page report). Given 3 months to rectify. \\- November 2024: Meghan asks for an extension of 3 months. This is still live. Below is a photo of Meghan taken in October 2024, when ARO was going tits up. https://preview.redd.it/upazgaww2zje1.jpg?width=829&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92f9af66e77d843073dda8d2f0b34dcede37792c In between there are stories of challenges to the trademark, and difficulties in finding a CEO. When, during this timeline, did Meghan realise that ’American Riviera Orchard’ would limit her to produce made on the American Riviera (TM) - which is Santa Barbara? And when she realised this, did she travel back in time to 2022 to register What Ever? And if she did this - why? 2. **TIL.** Brands named after places *must* be manufactured in those places. So Club Monaco clothing’s made in Monaco; Patagonia gear is manufactured in Patagonia: Donna Karan New York‘s produced in New York; Banana Republic’s made in, um, a banana republic; The North Face winter clothing’s manufactured around Mount Everest. I mean, that’s why American Riviera Orchard was renamed the more geographically ambiguous As Ever. 3. **The real reason for marrying a prince of the realm.** Seemingly, to get her Tig blog made into a television series. Seems like overkill, but it worked! So basically she’s going to be shilling products, either (cough) made by her (what’s the obsession with jam?), or which she’s paid to promote. I’m no marketing person, but I think she married more money than she’ll ever make. 4. **A mother and her 2 children.** The new logo of What Ever, irresistibly reminds one of the Papa and Mama palm trees at Olive Garden Montecito - except that Papa’s missing. But there are 2 birds, maybe representing 2 children. https://preview.redd.it/b3mcwc6i4zje1.png?width=120&amp;format="}
{"brand": "Patagonia", "archetype": "Explorer", "source": "reddit", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultralight/comments/i19ozo/its_time_to_cancel_fleece/", "text": "\"It's Time to Cancel Fleece\" \"**It's Time to Cancel Fleece**\" &gt;\"*We can do better for the environment.*\" This is an article from [Backpacker Magazine](https://www.backpacker.com/stories/its-time-to-cancel-fleece) that touches on why I am trying to phase out fleece as much as possible from my own gear- microplastics. Not sure if everyone's already seen it, but thought it's worth sharing. (Personally I've noticed these unidentifiable little fibers that seem to be the bane of using communal or commercial washers/dryers. They adhere to everything but especially towels and end up as dust on bathroom countertops. I don't know what they're from, but regardless it really drives home to me how much microplastics that fleece clothing articles may be shedding into the environment.) &gt;Fleece probably saved my life. I had just dumped my canoe in light rapids on a cool and overcast summer morning in northern Maine. I caught the throw bag, got hauled out, and started shivering despite the adrenaline from my first-ever whitewater swim. And then I did as I was told: I removed my sodden Patagonia, windmilled it over my head until it was dry enough to hold warmth, and put it back on. As we all know, synthetic fleece, even when wet, is a good insulator. &gt;There’s a lot to love about fleece. It’s cozy, more affordable than other insulating layers, performs consistently, and it’s hard to destroy. I own several fleeces, as does just about everyone I know. And I feel a sense of guilt for what it’s doing to our planet. &gt;Fleece—even the recycled stuff—is bad for the environment because it sheds. Every time you wash yours, millions of microscopic plastic particles swish off it and out your washer’s drain hose. According to a study conducted by Patagonia and the University of California Santa Barbara in 2016, your average fleece sheds about 1.7 grams of microplastic per wash cycle (recycled fleece sheds a bit less per cycle). Older fleece sheds more than newer fleece; generic more than name brand. &gt;To put that into context, in 2019, 7.8 million fleeces were sold, according to The NPD Group which tracks point-of-sale transactions across the outdoor industry. If every fleece sold last year was washed just once, that would equate to 15 tons of microplastics introduced into our air and water. According to another 2016 study from researchers in Scotland, American waste water treatment plants can catch more than 98 percent of microplastics, but even with such a high catchment rate, each plant still pumps out some 65 million microplastic fragments daily. &gt;Microplastic has proliferated far and wide in the 70 years since the bonanza began. It’s now in our tap water, milk, beer, you name it. According to a 2019 study by the World Wildlife Foundation, the average person ingests 9 ounces of plastic per year—that’s 5 grams, or the equivalent of one credit card, per week entering into our digestive tracts, lungs, and bloodstream. No one yet knows exactly what harm this causes, but there’s a reason we don’t shred up our shopping bags and mix them with our salads. &gt;This is nothing new—that Patagonia/UC Santa Barbara study has been out for years—and yet very little has happened to mitigate the problem. And so it’s time for consumers for put pressure on the gear manufacturers to start using more eco-friendly materials. &gt;True, Patagonia has worked to reduce the amount of microplastic that slough off its fleeces in the washing machine. And last year, Polartec released Power Air, a knit fleece that sheds 5 times less microplastic than a standard fleece. But there is no such thing as a fleece that doesn’t shed little bits of plastic in the wash. It’s easy to congratulate ourselves when 20 recycled soda bottles went into making our insulating garments, but 20 single objects are significantly easier to scoop up out of the waste stream than microscopic plastic fragments. &gt;So what do you do with all that fleece you already own? Hang onto it. Wear it until"}

For the first iteration, we’re going to be going over one of /r/malefashionadvice’s original loves: [workwear](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/search?q=workwear%20inspiration&amp;restrict_sr=1). MFA and workwear have had a long and storied relationship, but in recent years it has taken a backseat to things like SLP. Despite that, workwear is still a somewhat popular look that is easily accessible and easy to start wearing when you are coming from the Basic Bastard. This thread is *not* meant to be a comprehensive informational guide on the roots of the Americana &amp; Workwear aesthetic. While that is an interesting topic, and is something I am interested in researching further, this is mainly meant to be an introductory wardrobe expansion guide for those that are new to fashion. ## Characteristics I should start by specifying that there is arguably a difference between Americana and workwear. Americana is a style inspired by heritage American clothing, while workwear is a style of clothing that draws from clothing worn by manual laborers. So while a greaser look might not perfectly fit into the aesthetic of workwear, and a french work jacket is not technically Americana, the aesthetics share so many similarities that making two separate guides would be difficult and unnecessary. From here on out, I will be calling the combination of the two aesthetics “workwear,” even though it would be more technically correct to include both each time. Traditionally, workwear has tough materials and roomier cuts. It is commonly associated with fabrics like denim, flannel, and canvas. Common footwear choices include leather boots and shoes. Common features of garments include tough materials, multiple pockets, and utilitarian roots. These garments were originally created for or chosen because of a combination of durability, utility, and price. A long time has passed since then, though, and fashion brands have drawn inspiration from and appropriated these looks for decades. Aside from manual laborers, plenty of garments have been taken from various militaries and incorporated into everyday fashion. Examples include [M43 jackets](https://www.norsestore.com/shared/91/69/orslow-us-army-jacket_u.jpg) and [breton shirts](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/55/c7/ec/55c7ecfe140bd96174bf7a984ef77a48.jpg), among many many others. Ideally, the modern versions of these clothes are made in their country of origin or another first\\-world country, and their durability should be on par with the originals. ## Buying ### Common Items **Jeans:** The most common and ubiquitous of any article of clothing under the workwear umbrella. You know what they are. Made of denim and usually blue, these pants eventually break\\-in and fit the wearer’s body like a glove. They can be worn with any casual outfit and you don’t have to feel bad about wearing them in the yard or spilling sauce on them. You probably already have these, but if you find yourself wanting another pair, consider trying a more roomy cut like the [Levi’s 501](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bi-ZWQkH0p7/) or [Unbranded 601](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0202/3942/products/UB601_FR_2400x.jpg?v=1496351476).

The process is called superwash. Wool has scales and those scales have the uncanny ability to stick to each other when agitated and wet. To remedy this “problem” textile scientists came up with a process that burns the scales off with chlorine so a coating can be applied. Officially dubbed Hercosett-125, the polymer based resin is added to chlorine treated wool fibres. This essentially makes the wool act like a synthetic (for a while). The polymer eventually degrades (micro-fibre pollution) and you are left with a weak garment prone to tearing. The whole process is also very energy intensive, chemical laden, and not environmentally friendly. \" Link: [https://medium.com/@austinhoefs/when-wool-is-no-longer-wool-9925f2c7fcfe](https://medium.com/@austinhoefs/when-wool-is-no-longer-wool-9925f2c7fcfe) For those wondering what alternatives there are, patagonia does use a different process that does not use chlorine or plastic.

(Months-Years). Hi everyone. Long story, short. Due to some tragic circumstances in my life, I (27yo) have decided to cycle around the world for a while. Not now, but maybe next year. I'm still working and saving. I have never done Bikepacking or Touring, but I have done lots and lots of km on roads, forest and singletracks. I've done several days or weeks hiking, camped in the wilderness many times. I've also gone backpacking. I know some will say that I should start slow, and see if I like this kind of life. And it's true, I will also start doing multi-day bike trips! But I also know that I love biking in nature, spending time outdoors, and camping. And truth be told I want/need to disappear for a while. So, I don't currently own any bikes, but I'm looking for one. Thats also why I'm writing this post! For some advice. I'm looking for a bike that can handle big loads, rough terrain, stuff like that. I'm planning on cycling maybe Germany (I live here) to Japan, and from there Alaska to Patagonia (my family lives in Chile), or I don't know yet, but so you have an idea of what kind of cycling I want to do. I have some knowledge of bike mechanics and such, and am willing to learn more in the coming weeks-months. I have a few bikes or brands in mind, but I don't know much, that's why I'm asking. Kona Unit X Bombtrack Surly The budget (for the bike) would be something between 2-3k € max, something like that. I don't know if it's also a good option to buy a frame, and from there, start assembling the bike with different components. Anyway, that's pretty much the plan. Any advice is welcome. Many thanks in advance! ❤️ Edit1: Thank you for all the answers❤️ I'm at work now, I will be reading everything later! Edit2: Thank you for all the replies, I will now see and respond. You guys are amazing! And THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH for the condolences and nice words too, that means a lot to me.❤️"}

Here are my wins and fails in the BIFL journey, summarized: &amp;#x200B; Wins: * Silverware: a bit scratched now, but I think any 18/10 or 18/8 stainless steel silverware will outlive me. * Corded drill: Dewalt, purchased in 2013. Cord is somewhat annoying, but there's no battery to fail and it never runs out of juice in the middle of a project. Newer batteries are better and easily replaceable, so this one is debatable now. 2013 was a different story! * Leatherman multi-tools: Looks identical to the day I was gifted it ten years ago. So long as you don't abuse it too badly, you'll be able to will it to your favorite kid. * Mechanical keyboard: Used this thing for11 years now, it still makes satisfying clickies just like the first day! * Fancy dress shirts from Brooks Brothers: I have 5 and I've worn them many, many, times. I think there's more risk of these becoming unfashionable than them actually getting worn out. I've heard BB has gone downhill, so I'd encourage you to do your research before committing to a brand. * Mountain bike: can be serviced, has survived five years of hard use. Keep up with maintenance and it'll last you longer than you want it to (because new bikes are so much better). * Big wool sweater: so cozy in winter, but I have to wear it with long sleeves cause the itch factor is insane. This thing shows almost no signs of wear and doesn't get smelly because it never touches my skin! Win-win. * Self-built desktop computer: I built it in summer 2012 for \\~$1000 and I've only upgraded the graphics card once. I can't play AAA games on high settings anymore but I can't imagine a laptop lasting anywhere near as long. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Fails: * Anything made of synthetic fabric: You'll get 1-2 decades out of good stuff, 3 if you're lucky or don't use it much. Applies to tents, backpacks, shoes, snow pants, any other recreational gear made of synthetics. Fancier brands don't last any longer than mid-level ones in my experience. * Non-stick pans. They're a wear item. * Logitech mouse - got ten years out of it before it started drifting :( * Any daily use soft good or clothing. I think great stuff which is well maintained might make it to to 20 years, but things like underwear or socks just aren't BIFL. * Darn Tough Socks: These typically last me 3-7 years. I've started air drying them now in hopes of pushing this. * Exofficio Boxer Briefs: these last around 5 years for me before they stretch out too much. Still super impressive for a pair of underwear. * Patagonia R1: 12 years in and it's still my main midlayer for hiking + splitboarding, but it's stretched out quite a bit and it's got a few little holes. I think I could push it to 20 or perhaps 25 if I'm lucky but synthetic fabrics only last so long when actually used. * Gloves: I've destroyed so many pairs of these skiing and mountain biking that I gave up on fancy brands and now use discount stuff. They just exist in such a brutal environment that if you're actually using them they break down after 2-3 seasons. Kinco, Free the Powder, and REI garage sale finds are my go to. * Any 3 layer rain jacket or hard shell: Fails after \\~3-8 years of recreational use. Maybe I can push to 8 with DWR retreatment and tenacious tape on wear spots, but these things just wear out and lose their waterproofness. 3 layer garments definitely last longer than 2.5, but they're not truly BIFL."}

If you just want the results / numbers, scroll to the bottom. If you want the whole story, read on: #####Why Do You Have So Many Extra Clothes? To get ahead of any questions: I have a bit of a clothing issue. I love clothes, and I also love having a variety of clothes for my three kids to express themselves with. I’ve also held on to many things that no longer fit me or my kids or my lifestyle over the years. I have also always loved thrifting. I used to give stuff exclusively to donation centers when we were done with it, but I never felt great about it because I’m aware of things like the Goodwill bins and how much donated clothing never finds a new home and ends up sent abroad or trashed, etc... So I probably keep too much rather than donating in case someone in our house might wear it one day. I do still donate, but I donate selectively to organizations that give clothes away for free, and I only give very good condition items that are specifically on their wishlist. #####My Poshmark Experience My first attempt at a donation alternative was Poshmark. I started listing my old clothes and my kids clothes on there. I did make some money and pass along some gems to new homes, but after about a year I was over the bins of clothing sitting around waiting for buyers, and the intermittent need to go find something and ship it. I had (and still have) a ton of clothes to offload, but Poshmark was too slow for me. Some of these clothes are expensive brands, but typically acquired well below retail, so maximizing the money I earned from selling was less important to me than it might be to others. #####Enter ThredUp. I started shopping a lot more on ThredUp because it feels like thrifting but it is so much more accessible when time is limited. Absolutely love it. I wanted to send clothes in, but was overwhelmed and confused about how it worked. Then I found r/thredup! I decided to go the premium route because of what I read here. I wanted the return assurance, higher acceptance rate, and to avoid horror stories of high-end items being rejected and “responsibly recycled.” I didn’t realize until I used premium consignment that the longer listing window is HUGE. A lot of stuff sold for me after it would have expired for the regular consignment. This is one of my main reasons now for preferring premium. #####Bags vs. Boxes I ordered a bag, sent it in, and liked what they accepted and the estimated payout. So, I ordered five more premium bags. The additional bags took WEEKS to come. Maybe months? I got impatient and ordered a label, printed it, and sent in a box of clothes. I could fit SO much more in the box! Given the $35 fee is the same either way, I now will only send in boxes. I used the five bags when they finally came because I didn’t want to waste them, but never again. #####Payout Eligible Brands / What to Send: I searched items to make sure they were accepted brands before I sent them. I still made some mistakes because there are brands with near identical names but one is accepted and the other isn’t. I sent in a couple nicer items that aren’t on the accepted brands list. One (a Merona trench) sold for enough that I was paid a few dollars, but the rest did not and I wouldn’t do this again. If it is going to take up space in the box, I want it to be eligible for payout. Also, they only ever accepted two or three pairs of jeans at a time from me, so I will never send more than two pairs in a box from now on. And what everyone says is true, they sometimes accept stuff they previously rejected, so I suggest sending it back in a second time. It it’s rejected twice, maybe just donate or consign elsewhere. #####Missing and Mislabeled Items For my first bag, I didn’t keep track"}

Brands like [Gramicci](https://gramicci.com), [Manastash](https://www.manastash.us), or [18 East](https://18east.co) will let you shop the look all day for $$$. Stores like [Hatchet Supply](https://hatchetsupply.com) are focused almost entirely on this look. And there's even a “Gorpcore” [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/gorpcore/)! So when Yvon Chouinard announced that he was transferring his Patagonia ownership [to a trust](https://www.patagonia.com/ownership/) three years ago, I was rather surprised to learn from the news stories that the first Patagonia products were…rugby shirts!?! I certainly knew this type of shirt, probably from the LL Bean and Lands’ End catalogs of the 80s and 90s. They had the white collar, the rubber buttons, and were thicker and heavier than standard polo shirts. I likely even had one or two of them at some point growing up. But they always seemed more like a preppy or Ivy thing, or perhaps vaguely British given the origins of rugby. So how did Patagonia, one of the most techy of outdoor brands, start out by selling rugby shirts??? Well it turns out that a major part of the rugby shirt story is indeed related to those dirtbag c"}

By his side stands a brilliant female scientist who is about as much a scientist as a horoscope column is peer-reviewed. Dr. Katherine Solomon, purveyor of noetic science, speaks lines of dialogue so profoundly absurd that every time she opened her mouth, I had to physically restrain myself from hurling my Kindle 10th Generation, currently running firmware 5.18.1, across the room.

Her brand of noetic science treats the mind like a cosmic radio broadcast, with humans as antennas tuned permanently to static, blocking most of the important signals. Every time she launched into another grand pronouncement about her revolutionary research, it sounded less like science and more like the keynote address by an Ouija board at the International Convention of Crystal Healing. The novel insists that her theories are poised to change the way we understand human thought. What they actually change is the reader’s tolerance for pseudoscience. By the time she finished one of her monologues, I half expected her to whip out crystals, tarot cards, and a chakra alignment chart to validate her _statistically significant_ data. The plot moves with the speed of a caffeinated rabbit yet manages to feel formulaic, like a will-they-won’t-they subplot dragged out long after everyone knows they will. Historical city? Check. Cryptic symbols? Check. Implausible escape that makes Mission Impossible look like a documentary? Double check. Attractive female lead who is there mostly to remind you that Dan Brown knows women exist? Triple check. The author probably has also discovered the secret art of literary filler. Thirty percent of this book is padding, serving the story as well as my H&amp;M Slim Fit Coup Etroite sweater and Hoka Clifton 10 sneakers serve the writing of this review. The result is a reading experience that feels less like a thriller and more like a treadmill - lots of motion, but you end up exactly where you started, only more exhausted. I would recommend this book only to readers who enjoy the masochistic pleasure of hate-reading, because this is the literary equivalent of Emily in Paris - Langdon in Prague. The only “Secret of Secrets” I wish Mr. Brown had unearthed was the one where an author learns to evolve instead of recycling the same plot on a fancier high-finish 120gsm Stora Enso paper.[1] 1.

AMA! Hi r/photography, I am Alex Buisse, I have been a full time photographer since 2011 and part-time redditor since even before that! I started out highly specialized in commercial adventure photography (alpine climbing, really), shooting for brands like Patagonia, Petzl and Mountain Hardwear. I then slowly expanded to other adventure sports and took a more documentarian/journalistic approach to many stories, helped by attending the famous Eddie Adams workshop in 2013. Then in 2016, I began branching out and shooting humanitarian projects for NGOs, mostly development and refugee projects. I am currently balancing the two in roughly equal proportions. One of the things I love the most about being a photographer is that it gives me an excuse to go on adventures and get to places I would otherwise never get access to. Highlights include climbing K2 (not to the summit, unfortunately), sailing around Cape Horn and between Scotland and the Lofoten, shooting portraits of Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, photographing the Rio Olympics, skiing to the North Pole and much more. I strongly believe in giving back and strengthening the photography community. This is why all the way back in 2010, I wrote the original reddit photoclass, which has since been run many, many times. It currently lives on on [r-photoclass.com](http://www.r-photoclass.com). It was a great project and I love how many people it has helped over the years. It has always been and will always remain free (and ad free). I have also more recently launched a free [mentorship project](https://www.alexbuisse.com/Mentorship/1). My work is visible on [my website](http://www.alexbuisse.com) and on [Instagram](http://www.instagram.com/alexbuisse).

I first became interested in fashion and dressing well early in my senior year of high school. I lurked on MFA and read a lot, but didn’t actively start trying to improve my wardrobe (which, you will see, was at that point, was comprised entirely of Polo T shirts, khaki shorts, and Sperry’s boat shoes complemented with an assortment of Patagonia/The North Face t shirts.

It fit within the personal item size requirements, and indeed fit fine under the seat. My ticket actually included a carry-on at no extra cost, so ostensibly I didn't NEED to fit as a personal item, except for the fact that on the outbound flight, the carry-on space available was running out and the airline started forcing people in economy to check their carry-ons, so I was thankful mine fit under the seat as a personal item. I carried: 2x pants (Both CRZ Yoga golf pants, Lululemon ABC pant clones, one charcoal one khaki) 1x shorts (generic swim shorts, dunno the brand, used for sleeping and in the pool) 5x shirts (one button-down - SIR7 brand on Amazon I have a bunch of these in different colors from Amazon, they absolutely do not wrinkle). Other shirts were Uniqlo and 32 Degrees tees, 2x short sleeve, 2; long. 5x underwear and pairs of socks 1x fleece (Patagonia Capilene Air, discontinued) 1x lightweight packable jacket (On Running Climate jacket) (Edit to note: even though it's 95 degrees in much of the US right now, San Fran still gets very chilly (some days highs in the 50s) and Yosemite got down into the upper 40s at night at elevation, so outerwear was necessary) Toiletry, medicine and sleep kit packed in a Travelon hanging organizer Laptop and charger (Thinkpad Carbon) Kindle Various electronics (chargers, earbuds, battery bank) Uniqlo sling bag packed into main bag I added 2x more shirts and a six pack of cushioned sole socks purchased on the trip (to relieve aching feet from walking so much), and a few small souvenirs. I was able to do laundry halfway through the trip. I also sink washed my khaki pants at one point after getting food grease on them. I rubbed hotel shower gel into the grease spots and scrubbed them with a washcloth, then agitated them by hand in the sink, squeezed them out as much as I could, and hung them up on the hotel balcony, and they were almost completely dry in the morning. I think the low humidity of Napa Valley helped with the drying a lot in this case, though, that might not have worked so well on the East Coast where I'm from. What I would do differently: if I did the same trip again: I would bring my Matador Freerain packable backpack instead of the sling, and shoes more suitable for hiking than the ones I wore, due to the hiking I did in Yosemite. I basically chose to dress more for the city/urban stuff (San Francisco and Napa) rather than Yosemite, but my shoes didn't have great tread on the mountain trails, and while carrying a sling while hiking did work (with 2 liters of water packed), it was annoying having it swing around on me while scrambling over rocks and stuff. I still do prefer a sling for city travel, but it wasn't great on the trail. Same story with my shoes (Kizik Madrid, black on black.) Again, perfect in the city, not so perfect during the hikes. I find it depends on the type of trail - I've hiked with the Kiziks here on the east coast and in Japan, where the trails are mostly dirt. But in Yosemite, most of the trails were sandy and there was a lot of exposed rock that was pretty smooth and slick, and I could have used more traction. Comfort-wise they were great; just could have used some more traction. I was concerned about looking too much like a hiker while dining in San Fran and wine tasting in Napa, but I shouldn't have been. I did not use the laptop during the trip, but I needed to bring it in case there was a work emergency. I need to stop bringing the Kindle, as I find I barely use it while traveling. I always think I'll read on the plane, but on the way out I just watched movies, and on the way back I was so dead tired that I slept during "}

I am well aware that the experiences with Xiaomi of the majority of Redditors in this Sub have been vastly different from mine, and mostly positive. Mostly because Consumer Laws in my country are dismal. In the past buying online, at Amazon, and Lands' End, twice, once each, I got not what I had purchased. And both times I was awarded a full refund. Do you think I will buy again from that seller at Amazon and Land' End? YOU BET I AM! Because they have given me the confidence that they put my satisfaction first and needed be I will get my money back. They have won a costumer for life. On August 1. 2025 I bought a Xiaomi Smart Band 10 at a small Xiaomi branded store in a Mall near my home, most likely a franchise or reseller owned and operated privately and neither owned nor operated directly by Xiaomi Global. The only reason I bought the Xiaomi Smart Band 10 was the step counter. But the Xiaomi Smart Band 10 that I bought had a defect and added thousands of steps while riding public transportation, on very ok streets, sitting, still. On the 7. I went to the store for a refund. They offered technical support and needed be a replacement. But I have lost confidence in the brand and want a refund. Things look like I won't be getting one. Apparently Xiaomi Global does not offer any kind of, let's name it, \"Xiaomi Total Global Satisfaction Warranty\", for all of its products or enforce a such warranty on its franchisers and resellers, as, I will give, very few brands do, for instance Patagonia, and can \"hide\" behind our local consumer laws. In me Xiaomi has now lost a costumer for life. Patagonia could do the same, as stated by local consumer laws, yet they do not, so it's possible, not any brand is bound not to treat their costumers better than stated by our dismal local consumer laws. Still, the world has become a little better because at least there are places like Reddit where I can at least vent my feelings and frustration and because of that, I thank you for reading. Yes I know. It's not Xiaomi Global doing it. It's the franchiser or reseller. But Xiaomi Global could enforce on its franchisers and resellers, a \"Xiaomi Way\", the right way to treat Xiaomi costumers."}

Turning Promises into Proof: Where Brand Meets Reality A brand promise is more than a catchy tagline—it’s a contract. When that promise aligns with a customer’s lived experience, trust compounds. When it doesn’t, credibility evaporates faster than you can issue an apology. In this post, we unpack how to evaluate and strengthen the bridge between what you say and what your customers actually feel. Why Brand Promise Matters More Than Ever Your brand promise is the emotional shorthand that tells customers what to expect from you. It’s the “why” behind their decision to choose you over competitors. But customers don’t measure your promise by your intentions—they measure it by their actual experience, moment by moment. A mid-sized SaaS company promised “enterprise-grade security with startup speed.” Their marketing was impressive. Their demos sparkled. But their customer success team was chronically understaffed, leading to 72-hour response times on critical issues. Within eighteen months, their Net Promoter Score dropped 40 points. The promise wasn’t a lie—their product could deliver. But the experience told a different story. This gap between promise and experience creates cognitive dissonance. And in a world where customers can switch providers with a few clicks, that dissonance becomes churn. Measure the Gap: The Brand Alignment Score Most companies sense something’s off between what they promise and what they deliver, but few measure it systematically. Try this diagnostic: The Brand Alignment Score (0-100) Promise Clarity (0-25): Can your frontline team articulate your brand promise without looking it up? Language Consistency (0-25): Do customers use the same emotional language in reviews that you use in marketing? Friction Mapping (0-25): How many touchpoints actively contradict your promise? Recovery Response (0-25): When things go wrong, does your response reinforce or undermine your promise? Anything below 70 suggests a meaningful gap. Below 50? You’re likely hemorrhaging trust without realizing it. Here’s what most companies miss: research from the Corporate Executive Board shows that customers who experience promise-delivery alignment are 32% less likely to churn and spend 13% more on average than customers who perceive even minor misalignment. The trust dividend isn’t theoretical—it shows up in retention rates and wallet share. Audit the Alignment: Listen First Want to know if your brand promise holds up? Stop talking and start listening. Ask customers this question: “If you had to describe your experience with us in three words, what would they be?” Then compare those words with your brand messaging. If customers say “confusing” and your website says “simple,” you’ve found your problem. Also track: NPS scores with qualitative follow-up, social media sentiment patterns, and support ticket themes. Real World Examples: Success and Failure Patagonia: Operational Integrity Patagonia promises environmental responsibility. But unlike brands that slap “sustainable” on marketing and call it a day, Patagonia built operations around this promise: They actively discourage overconsumption with “Don’t Buy This Jacket” campaigns Their Worn Wear program repairs and resells used gear They publish their factory list and supply chain challenges openly They’ve donated over $140 million to environmental causes Employees get paid time off for environmental activism When the brand faced criticism over factory conditions in 2011, their transparent response actually strengthened customer loyalty. This is what happens when operations, culture, and messaging are in lockstep.

It differs in the fact that it is not sponsored by the brand nor do the creators have any monetary gains to make from the content they have produced. And a lot of brands are now leveraging these user generated content pieces in their individual marketing efforts. This could be because UGC is known to be 20% more influential than any other type of media when it comes to driving Millennial’s purchasing decisions. In this blog we are going to quickly look at some leading brands that are using user generated content and winning the marketing game. And learn from their tactics to implement in our own initiatives and efforts. **Why UGC Matters: The Power of Customer-Generated Content** Did you know that content created by real people greatly sways purchasing choices across age groups? Over 79% of individuals are influenced by it and 93% find it extremely helpful! That is a massive number. And not one that must be ignored if you want to make use of the content your users and audience have created for you. But that is not all. User generated content isn’t just more trustworthy, it is a lot helpful for boosting SEO factors as well. Because UGC tends to unknowingly incorporate long tail keywords, specific facts and figures, and candid content that search engines like Google favour for being unbiased and human written content. With that being said we hope you are ready to dive into some great examples of user generated content across different brands. Let us check them out. **10 Best User-Generated Content Examples in Action** **A. Social Media UGC** * **GoPro** \\- Their entire social media strategy revolves around featuring stunning videos and pictures taken by clients using their cameras. The “Photo Of The Day”, along with other hashtag competitions, motivates clients to post GoPro content on social media. * **Apple’s “Shot On iPhone”** \\- Campaigns shot with the phone by regular iphone users are put on a billboard around the globe and on social media for everyone to see. Showcases the camera features available in their devices. * **Starbucks’ “White Cup Contest”** \\- Guests were allowed to personalize the plain white Starbucks cups and post pictures of them on social media. The winning design was turned into a limited edition reusable cup. * **Airbnb Instagram strategy** \\- They have ever featured pictures taken by the hosts and the guests at actual Airbnb properties, which show real life rather than promotional materials to market the brand. * **Coca-Cola “Share a Coke” campaign** \\- By customizing their bottles with names and asking people to post a picture whenever they come across a bottle with their name, Coca-Cola sparked millions of social media posts. * **Adobe #Adobe\\_Perspective** \\- The Software Company uses hashtag posts to show off art made using their products. They also feature the user generated content on the company’s page and social media. * **Lululemon #thesweatlife** \\- The athletic apparel brand encourages customers to take pictures of themselves doing various activities while clad in Lululemon clothing and post them on social media. * **“Crash the Super Bowl” by Doritos -** Super Bowl aired commercials made by fans, enabling them to win and have them aired. For quite a while do-it-yourself commercials were broadcast by Doritos, extending prize-winning opportunities in the form of fans turned superbowl winners. * **Hashtag AsSeenOnMe by ASOS.** Customers are entitled to post pictures showcasing their outfits, tagging the fashion retailer. The snapshots are displayed on their corporate website and social media platforms, providing them with a requisitioned feed of genuine buyers. * **Glossier**.

Traditional Frameworks Are Dead AIDA worked when people had 30-second attention spans. Now? Now audience wants authenticity, impact, and community. These frameworks reflect how people actually buy in 2025. These are the top frameworks I use frequently: --- **1. PASTOR 2.0 (The Movement Builder)** Turns your product into a social movement **The Prompt**: &gt; Using the 'PASTOR 2.0' framework, develop a campaign that identifies the systemic [problem] affecting [ideal customer persona], amplifies its broader implications for society, shares authentic brand stories and customer journeys, includes diverse testimonials and case studies, presents our [offer] as part of a larger movement for positive change, and invites community participation. **Real example**: Patagonia's \"Don't Buy This Jacket\" campaign. Turned environmental activism into $1B revenue. --- **2. Features-Advantages-Benefits-Impact (The Conscious Consumer)** Shows your audience they're buying change, not just a product **The Prompt**: &gt; Design a 'Features-Advantages-Benefits-Impact' campaign that showcases how the [features] of our [product/service] create [advantages] for [ideal customer persona], deliver personal [benefits], and contribute to positive environmental or social [impact]. Use interactive content formats and real-time personalization. **Why it works**: Gen Z and Millennials need to feel their purchases matter beyond themselves. --- **3: Awareness-Understanding-Connection-Action (The Educator)** Builds trust through education before asking for the sale **The Prompt**: &gt; Create an 'Awareness-Understanding-Connection-Action' campaign that introduces [ideal customer persona] to emerging challenges or opportunities, helps them understand the implications through educational content, creates emotional connection through shared values and community engagement, and motivates action toward sustainable solutions using our [product/service]. **Hot take**: This is how HubSpot became a $30B company. They educated before they sold. --- **4. Hero-Journey-Transformation (The Story Seller)** Makes your customer the hero, not your brand **The Prompt**: &gt; Develop a 'Hero-Journey-Transformation' campaign using transmedia storytelling to position a relatable character facing similar challenges as [ideal customer persona]. Chronicle their journey of discovery and growth, showing authentic transformation achieved through community support and our [product/service], emphasizing genuine outcomes over perfection. **Secret sauce**: Show the struggle, not just the success. Vulnerability converts better than perfection. --- **5. Vision-Promise-Evidence-Momentum (The Trust Builder)** Creates FOMO through social proof and community engagement **The Prompt**: &gt; Using the 'Vision-Promise-Evidence-Momentum' framework, paint an inspiring picture of positive change that resonates with [ideal customer persona]'s values. Make authentic promises about impact and outcomes, provide transparent evidence through real-time data and verified testimonials, and create momentum through community challenges and gamified experiences. **Pro tip**: The \"momentum\" part is crucial. Static testimonials are dead. Dynamic, real-time social proof is everything. --- **How I Use These** 1. **Pick ONE framework** per campaign (don't mix) 2. **Fill in the blanks** with your specific details 3. **Test with small audiences** first 4. **Scale what works**, kill what doesn't 5. **Measure beyond conversions** (engagement, sharing, brand sentiment) **Want more free frameworks** Visit, [copywriting frameworks](https://tools.eq4c.com/) for 20 free frameworks with prompts."}

Once a week I’ll share a bit about an outdoor brand or product, where it came from, how it started, and why it ended up becoming part of adventure culture. Hope this helps to know and share more cool brands and handy products to help us in our adventures! The first one is **Patagonia**. 1. How it started So from what I found, back in the 1950s Yvon Chouinard actually taught himself blacksmithing just so he could make climbing gear for himself and his friends. His pitons were handmade in a little shop and turned out to be way better than what was around at the time. Climbers really took to them, and it kind of changed the sport. 2. From tools to a brand Fast forward to 1973, he set up Patagonia. At first it was still pretty small, but it slowly grew from a side project into one of the biggest names in outdoor gear. 3. Repair, reuse, rethink One thing I didn’t know until recently is that Patagonia started this program called *Worn Wear*. The whole idea is to repair and reuse your gear instead of throwing it out and buying new. (I think that’s pretty cool, especially since they’ve been pushing that idea for years, way before it was trendy!) 4. Why it matters today For me, the takeaway is that Patagonia isn’t just about jackets or fleeces. It’s about keeping gear (and the stories that come with it) alive for as long as possible. In a time when so much stuff feels disposable, that’s kind of refreshing. Do you wear anything Patagonia? What do you think about the brand?"}

A place where time slows, where the earth feels stitched together with horse tracks and cattle trails, and where eating isn’t just a necessity. It’s a ritual, a contact sport, a communion with the land. The centerpiece is lamb, suspended over smoldering wood embers, kissed by smoke and flame until the skin crackles like parchment and the meat falls away with indecent ease. Around it, bowls of mountain vegetables and garden herbs are transformed into bright salads, plates of tomatoes that taste like the sun itself, and chimichurri so alive with green fire it could double as jet fuel for the soul. This isn’t polite dining. It’s primal, wild, celebratory, the kind of meal that makes you remember what food is supposed to be before we drowned it in plastic and marketing. The estancia is more than just a dining table. It’s the start line for the kind of adventures that stain clothes with dirt and grins with adrenaline. Riding horseback across valleys carved by glaciers, trekking through jagged ridges where condors float overhead like prehistoric aircraft, kayaking along icy blue rivers that could freeze your bones yet warm your spirit. This is a playground for the reckless, the romantic, and the ones who still believe the world has corners left to explore. And yet, when the sun finally leans heavy against the horizon, all of that energy folds into something quieter. A long wooden table under the Patagonian sky, bottles of bold Malbec uncorked and passed hand to hand, the scent of woodsmoke and roasted lamb hanging thick in the air. The night becomes a symphony of laughter, clinking glasses, and stories that never make it to paper. Patagonia is not a place that tolerates half-measures, and the seasons shape its hospitality with brutal honesty. Summer is the crown jewel. The right time to throw yourself into every canyon, river, and mountain path, when the air is warm, the nights long, and the stars stretch across the sky like spilled salt. It’s the season when the estancia wakes up fully, alive with travelers chasing both adrenaline and the kind of food that only comes from land wrestled into generosity. There are meals that feed you, and there are meals that brand you with memory. At this table, in this wild corner of Argentina, the difference is roasted into every bite.

Hello, I was hesitant in purchasing my Atom LT but it was very comfortable when I tried it on so I bit the bullet. I was hesitant because I’ve read all of the horror stories on how fragile this jacket is. I wore mine 20 times in the city with 3-4 times wearing a school backpack. Upon inspection today i noticed the dreaded face fabric bunching up and pilling. I’m not going to bother buying another one, so are there any other models by arcteryx or other brands that make a good synthetic insulated jacket with ok breathability? Lifetime warranty would be a big plus I’m looking at the Patagonia Nano Air (non hybrid) and maybe the Nanopuff? But it doesn’t look breathable at all with the shiny face fabric. Are there any other good ones?"}

A pang of anxiety hit me as my mind raced along the long and unknown road ahead - picturing broken rims and blown tyres, snapped carbon, struggle and suffering and ultimately failure. My bike was surely too heavy. I stood with my partner Claire, in a driveway of an AirBnB in Puerto Varas, Chile – our launching pad for an almost 1500km journey along the great Carretera Austral, the single road which navigates North-South through the southern Aysen District in Patagonian Chile. This was the first time we had fully loaded up our bicycles, ever. We had no overnight cycling trips under our belts. I cycled recreationally and Claire was more of a commuter. Hopefully she won’t mind me relaying this story, as I see it as a testament to her absolute grit – during a 60km training ride three weeks prior (perhaps the second or third time she’d ever ridden that far), at 55km she folded and called her sister for a pick-up. We were green. We’d also flown our bicycles and all our gear 12 hours from Australia for this experiment, I felt sick and ridiculous. We jumped on the bikes and took them for a tentative spin around the block. I feel the frame flexing strangely under the weight, and the steering at low speed like having two wild dogs tied to the handlebars and I try to convince myself that this is going to be OK. With me being a bit of a gear nerd and with more of an interest in equipment – I had spent months going down rabbit holes online trying to prepare for something I really knew nothing about. We felt confident with the aspect of camping and living outdoors through our experience with mountaineering and back country hiking – but distributing that equipment on a bicycle was unknown territory for us. The internet is full of opinions and advertising, if you’re anything like me balancing getting the best product with practicality of what you actually need creates this endlessly spinning vortex of recommendations and brands. Panniers and racks or bike bags? Touring or mud tyres? Schwalbe, Ortlieb, Restap, Apidura. Weight vs Speed. Then came the problem that essentially all opinions online advised against using full carbon bikes for remote touring, and also using 1x cranksets was not ideal. Claire’s bike is both of these things. I was so stressed and convinced of this being a huge problem, we even started looking locally for alternative bikes for her, which thankfully we were unable to find anything suitable. In my stress and desperation I turned to an extreme and last resort option, I talked to real life human beings who had ridden thousands of kilometres on their bicycles – and I got a profound piece of advice (well actually two pieces of profound advice from two different people). Just use what you’ve got and go. Just go. The second bit of advice actually completely conflicts with the first bit, but I’m going to include it because it is the piece of advice that I considered and appreciated the most once we were on our adventure – Put the easiest gearing available on your bike. You're only going to wish for more granny gears. I messaged the local bike shop tech thanking him profusely for that one, Patagonia is hilly. But I suppose in the end, it was simply a ‘nice to have’. We set off from Puerto Varas two days later with the agreement if we hated it after a week, we would return and probably hire a car for the trip. The rest is history as they say. As we continued south we completely fell in love with everything about this mode of travel. The simplicity, the suffering, the achievement, the exposure to people and the environment. I see so many questions on these subs which would be answered by just going and giving it a shot. You are capable as you are, it’s meant to be an adventure after all!"}

Introduction In the vast landscape of winter headwear, where countless brands compete for dominance with promises of warmth, style, and durability, one small company from Cleveland, Ohio has quietly revolutionized an industry that seemed impossible to improve. Haakwear, with their patented H-Stitch™ technology, has solved a problem so fundamental yet so overlooked that it took a founder with military experience and an intimate understanding of comfort under demanding conditions to recognize it: the traditional beanie’s fatal flaw lies not in its materials or construction quality, but in the very placement of its seams. This is the story of how a Cleveland-based manufacturer has potentially created the most comfortable beanie humanity has ever worn, and why major brands like Carhartt, Nike, Under Armour, The North Face, and Patagonia—despite their decades of experience and billion-dollar research budgets—have failed to address a problem that affects millions of people worldwide every winter. The implications of this innovation extend far beyond mere comfort. For construction workers wearing hard hats, motorcyclists donning helmets, skiers and snowboarders requiring head protection, aviators using headsets, and countless others who must wear headgear for extended periods, the H-Stitch™ represents nothing less than a paradigm shift in how we think about the relationship between our heads and the gear that protects them. The Beanie — More Than Just a Hat The humble beanie occupies a unique position in human civilization. Unlike other articles of clothing that serve primarily aesthetic or cultural purposes, the beanie is fundamentally utilitarian—a piece of survival gear that has transcended its practical origins to become a global symbol of comfort, style, and identity. From the frozen construction sites of northern Canada to the windswept peaks of the Himalayas, from the bustling streets of New York City in January to the ski slopes of the Swiss Alps, beanies serve as humanity’s first line of defense against the cold. Yet for all their ubiquity and importance, beanies have remained remarkably unchanged in their fundamental design for decades. The traditional construction method—which involves gathering fabric at the crown of the head and securing it with seams—creates what industry insiders have long accepted as an inevitable compromise. This compromise manifests as a pressure point directly at the top of the skull, precisely where the human head is most sensitive to sustained pressure and exactly where helmets, hard hats, headphones, and other protective gear exert their greatest force. The consequences of this design flaw are far more significant than most people realize. Construction workers report headaches after long shifts wearing hard hats over traditional beanies [1]. Motorcyclists describe the discomfort of crown seams pressing into their scalp during extended rides [2]. Skiers and snowboarders frequently remove their beanies mid-slope due to pressure-induced pain [3]. Aviation professionals struggle with the interaction between headset equipment and beanie seams [4]. Even office workers wearing headphones over beanies in cold environments experience the familiar ache that comes from sustained pressure on the crown of the head. This problem is so pervasive that it has spawned an entire category of workarounds and compromises. Some people size up their helmets to accommodate the bulk of traditional beanies, potentially compromising safety. Others choose thinner, less warm options that provide inadequate protection from the cold. Many simply endure the discomfort, accepting it as an unavoidable aspect of winter gear. Safety experts have even begun recommending against wearing any headwear under protective equipment, leaving workers and athletes to choose between warmth and comf"}

Yes — **storytelling significantly improves brand trust**, and it's backed by both psychology and marketing data. Here’s why storytelling works so powerfully in building trust: # 🔍 1. It Humanizes the Brand * Stories **put a face** to your brand. Instead of a cold logo or generic messaging, people see **real values, struggles, and intentions.** * Example: A solopreneur sharing how they turned their garage hobby into a thriving DIY class builds instant credibility. 🧠 **Why it works:** Humans are wired to connect with narratives, not bullet points. # 📌 2. Stories Create Emotional Bonds * Great stories **spark emotion**—joy, empathy, inspiration, or even nostalgia. * Emotion is a shortcut to trust. If people **feel** something, they’re more likely to **believe** and **remember** your brand. 🧠 Brain science backs this: Emotionally charged stories increase oxytocin, which fosters bonding and trust. # ✅ 3. It Makes Information Stick * Stories make complex ideas **easier to understand** and retain. * Instead of saying “We’re eco-friendly,” a brand telling a story about **saving 1 million plastic bottles** builds a **vivid, memorable** impression. 🧠 Story = structure + memory hook. # 💬 4. Testimonials Are Stories, Too * Case studies, customer journeys, before-after stories = social proof + relatability. * These build trust because others' **lived experiences** feel more reliable than ads. # 📣 5. Authenticity Beats Perfection * In 2025, consumers crave **real** over polished. When you share struggles, mistakes, or humble beginnings, people see honesty. * A story like: “I failed at launching my first DIY class. Here's what I changed…” builds far more trust than hypey promises. # 🔁 Real-World Brand Examples: |Brand|Story Angle|Result| |:-|:-|:-| |**Airbnb**|Hosts' personal stories|Built global community trust| |**Warby Parker**|Founders couldn't afford glasses|Positioned as affordable disruptors| |**Patagonia**|Environmental activism stories|Deep trust with eco-conscious buyers| # ✍️ Pro Tip for Small Brands: Even a short brand story on your About page or social post—who you are, why you started, and how you help—can convert strangers into believers."}
{"brand": "Patagonia", "archetype": "Explorer", "source": "reddit", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1gf5eyk/mea_culpa/", "text": "Mea culpa I was planning to write a post trying to explain Ryanair to non-Europeans and claiming essentially two things: 1) That no one checks size and weight of your bag up until 35/40 litres. I have flown dozens (literally) of times in Europe over the last 10 years and the only company which ever checked one of my bags was Wizz air, while I was able to consistently embark with backpacks which are maybe not too big (I don't use 40l as a personal item), but definitely oversized and weirdly shaped, like my Gregory Zulu 30 hiking pack, which is very tall. (On the other hand, everyone is quite strict about the number of items, so often they ask passenger to put their +1 in the backpack, even if it is just a small purse or a sling). 2) That the space under the seat in front is not allocated equally on Ryanair Boeing 737s, but more like 30% for the window seat, 50% for the middle one and 20% for the aisle, so it might be worth getting a middle seat if one has a bigger than usual backpack. Other companies, especially those using Airbus A320 planes like Lufthansa, allocated space equally and the planes are, in general, more spacious and comfortable. The second point is true, but I was very, very wrong about the first one. The full story is that I travelled to Toulouse, in the south-west of France, for a weekend and I only took a single backpack with me, because it was just a weekend and it was the perfect occasion to test my brand new Patagonia mini MLC 30 which I bought on sale a couple of weeks ago. Both legs were with Ryanair, but, while the first one was uneventful, for the second one we were not only asked to depart from the international terminal, which meant that we had to pass a useless passport control, but also that they were checking the size of both the personal item and the carry on luggage. Again, this has not happened to me in many years, more than 5 for sure, and on countless of Ryanair flights, but I was pretty confident, also because my backpack was not overpacked, so I thought that I just needed to put my jumper and my down jacket on (I had taken them off because it was hot) and I would have no problem. Unfortunately, when I tried to slip it into the box, it was a little too big and one of the straps got stuck outside and prevented the backpoack from getting fully in. The lady at the counter could already smell the 60€ fee. After a moment of panic, I moved to the end of the queue, I put my rain shell on, I put my dopp kit inside the inner pocket (just in case), moved the water bottle to inside the pack (to avoid discussions) and passed to the duffle configuration and, lo and behold, I can confirm that a (not overpacked) Patagonia mini MLC 30 does fit in a Ryanair personal item sizer. Phew About the bag, it packs nice, but the straps are a little worse than I thought. There is quite some space between the mesh and the rest of the pack, so it might be worth packing it separately or keeping the mesh open in case of bigger items. An eagle creek large packing cube is a tad too large to fit in the pack."}

Just… nothing. At first, people coped. They journaled. They meditated. They posted on Threads. But by hour three, the cracks started showing. A woman on my street was screaming “VALUE FIRST, ALWAYS” into a ring light... even though it wasn’t plugged in. A ghostwriter I know tried posting an article on Substack. He titled it: “The Time I Broke Down in a Starbucks Bathroom… and Closed a $15K Client 3 Hours Later” It got two reads. By hour six, LinkedIn influencers formed a circle at a WeWork and took turns describing their “origin story.” No one clapped. But they kept going. One guy live-streamed himself reading his pinned post out loud. Nobody watched, so he watched it himself on another phone for engagement. By hour ten, startup founders were drawing carousels on napkins and tossing them into traffic. You’d see one float by: Slide 1: “I was fat, broke and depressed…” Then it’d get run over by a bus. By hour sixteen, a brand strategist tried handing out personal mission statements at the farmer’s market. Nobody took one. Not even the kombucha guy. At hour twenty-three, someone created a Slack group called “Emergency Thought Leadership Hub.” They charged $9.7K for lifetime access. Six people joined. All of them were coaches. And then… it came back. No apology. No warning. The algorithm resumed like nothing happened. And everyone went right back to scheduling their next post about vulnerability. But I remember. I remember the moment the engagement ran dry. I remember the sound of quiet. And honestly? It was kind of nice."}

Make them feel this It was a **typical Saturday morning**, and I found myself sitting in my favorite coffee shop, lost in my coffee, when suddenly I heard a loud commotion at the door. https://preview.redd.it/yg6jufvul7bf1.jpg?width=1679&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d47c63c940ededbad83c8eeb0cbf8743ef9705c3 I looked up to see a **group of people,** all dressed in **football** kits, walking into the cafe. They looked like they had just come from a game, and by their body language, laughter, and the excited voices of some of them loudly discussing incidents from the match, it was clear that they had won. All of them were smiling, **celebrating their victory** as they ordered their coffee. As I sat there, watching this **group of strangers bond** over their **shared experience**, I couldn't help but feel a twinge of envy, even though I did not know anyone from them. But then it hit me, this was a classic example of the \"**in-group effect**\" in action. You see, as humans, we have a natural tendency to identify with and feel a **sense of belonging** to a certain group based on shared characteristics or experiences. And in this case, those matching kits, and the high 5s were the equivalent of a secret handshake, signaling that they were part of the same exclusive club. Well, while the story ended, here is what some brands have understood this, and have enjoyed the benefits. 1. **NikePlus** \\- A membership program that offers exclusive product releases, personalized recommendations, and access to exclusive events and experiences. Benefits include increased brand loyalty and customer retention. 2. **Patagonia Worn Wear** \\- A program that encourages customers to repair and recycle their Patagonia clothing, promoting sustainability and reducing waste. Benefits include increased brand loyalty and customer retention. 3. **GoPro Hero** \\- A community for GoPro users to share and discover videos and photos captured with the camera. Benefits include increased brand engagement and user-generated content. 4. **Harley Owners Group (HOG**) - A community for Harley-Davidson motorcycle owners to connect and share their experiences. Benefits include increased brand loyalty and customer retention. 5. **Red Bull Air Race** \\- A community and program for fans of the Red Bull Air Race to access exclusive content, such as behind-the-scenes footage, and participate in fan events. Benefits include increased brand loyalty and customer retention. 6. **Under Armour Connected Fitness** \\- A community and program for customers to track and share their fitness progress, as well as access exclusive content and offers. Benefits include increased brand loyalty and customer retention. What is stopping you from using it for your brand?"}

A first-time fund run by people who actually know the field, not just the spreadsheets. Or a startup solving a real-world crisis—plastic in the ocean, hunger in the slums, water in the desert, restoring the health of soil and increasing income and yield of farmers. What do they say? “We don’t invest in first-time funds.” “You’re a bit early for us.” “Come back with more traction.” “We’re watching the space.” “How can we get rid of the smallholder farmers with robots and drones?\" \"We only invest in Tier 1 Fund Managers, even if they have a lousy track record. But who cares? They have a brand.\" Translation: **We love change—as long as someone else goes first.** **You can practically smell the cowardice wrapped in fiduciary-speak.** **The Institutional Cowardice Machine** They wrap their refusal in compliance, polish it with consultants, and pass it through committees full of lawyers in Patagonia vests. What we get is not due diligence—it’s *due cover-your-ass*. This is the same mentality that made IBM the default purchase for decades: “No one ever got fired for playing it safe.” Now it's: “No one ever got fired for ignoring a risky solution that might save the world.” Meanwhile, the house is on fire. And these people are still checking if the fire extinguisher is ESG-compliant. **First-Time Funds = First Responders (But Unfunded)** Here’s what the data actually says—if anyone bothered to look: * First-time funds frequently **outperform** legacy ones (Cambridge Associates, Kauffman Fellows—Google it). * They’re lean. Focused. Obsessed. They’re not managing reputations—they’re *building* them. * They don’t have the luxury of coasting. Every dollar counts. Every LP matters. But no one wants to be the first to bet on them. Because God forbid it doesn’t 3x in 36 months and someone has to explain to the board why they took a risk with… *purpose.* **Startups? Even Worse.** Startups solving real impact problems? Same story. Only worse. Founders dealing with food insecurity, water scarcity, migrant inclusion—actually innovating where it hurts—get told: “Too early.” “Where’s the traction?” “Come back when you’ve raised a bridge round on your seed extension from your Series A.” You’d think they were trying to build a flying car out of compost. Meanwhile, an enterprise AI startup that automates carbon credits for yachts gets a $20M Series A and a Harvard Business Review feature. This isn’t just ridiculous. It’s **systemic negligence disguised as prudence.** **The Great Impact Lie** The whole impact investing sector is bloated with **beautiful decks and spineless decisions.** Everyone’s got: * ESG checklists * DEI language * SDG slide decks * Impact Committees * Climate Task Forces But **capital remains stuck in paralysis.** Impact, they say? Great! Now show us your IRR, MOIC, ARR, and preferably some mainstream press coverage. And if you haven’t raised $5M already from someone they know? Sorry. Can’t help you. Come back when someone else believes. Let’s call it what it is: **Virtue signaling with a balance sheet.** **Risk aversion in a recycled Patagonia fleece.** **Change theater.** **The People Closest to the Problem? Systemically Locked Out** Who’s launching these first-time funds and grassroots startups? * Women * People of color * Operators from the Global South * Builders with lived experience, not just MBAs The exact people the impact sector claims to empower. And they’re the ones **getting iced out by outdated risk models and Ivy League gatekeeping**. Because the system still funds what it knows. And what it knows tends to look like… well, the people doing the funding. Impact investing wasn’t supp"}

I'll be spending a week in Coventry, England, a week in Barcelona, and a week in Toulouse, France for work conferences. I get to add a week in the middle somewhere for fun and I think it will likely be a week of vacationing in Barcelona (I've bought the tickets to and from Europe but not the connections). I work in a field so casual that it's pretty standard to wear printed T-shirts to conferences and I'm not presenting, so I don't have to worry about blazers or hard pants. We usually get one afternoon off for sight-seeing/exploring the area during conferences. But the week of vacationing is a bit of a celebration, so I might want to go somewhere a little nice to eat (we're not talking fine dining because I'll be doing this alone). I've been researching a lot and I just can't figure out *specific pieces* that my wardrobe is missing. I know I need at least one more bottom and probably a few more tops, but I just can't figure out what it needs. Maybe a skirt? But I think I might be stuck thinking to narrowly (linen or wool, knee length, navy or gray) and thought I would open it up to see if anyone had any ideas. The first picture is what I'm planning on including in my travel capsule: navy linen pants, coral dress, gray merino shell, navy merino shell, gray cardigan, blue/purple shawl, polyester (but very quick drying) plaid button down+cami for the plane. I just realized that I forgot my long sleeved gray merino top. [Here's what's coming with me](https://preview.redd.it/dzf7ulqtcdve1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=388b554b771ec213589a8b123c91c1f67ff533d2) The second picture is a random collection of clothes that I already have and think might have potential that I can't figure out (green merino zip up sweater, purple polyester top, coral polyester top, purple/coral button down quick dry tops, gray dress, blue and coral cotton/poly blend tops, blue cotton dress, printed convertible skirt/dress, teal skirt, gray ponte pants). Also, I want to emphasize, this is just the everyday wear. I have a Patagonia nanopuff that I always pack, as well as a rain jacket, and I think I've figured out shoes, underwear, pajamas, etc. Still working on workout clothes. [Does anything here have potential to flesh out what I'm bringing?](https://preview.redd.it/gqkqtdx8ddve1.jpg?width=3776&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59e3d51b2f68244f092082fc85f85cdabc9ae6bc) Would the teal skirt work as the missing piece? Or that printed skirt/dress combo? Longer story: I know I *can* one-bag this because I did 10 days last summer (with 10 unique tops/dresses) in a 42 Allpa twice: once to Spain/Italy, once to Scotland/England (without laundry both times). On the first trip someone commented on my one-bagging and said \"you should check out one-bag reddit.\" Obviously it's better here. It was through this sub-reddit that I learned about capsule wardrobes and understood a problem I've had with both life and travel: although my neutrals lend themselves well to navy/gray, my shoes (and travel pants) were all either brown or black. I realized that if I switch to navy and gray bottoms (and shoes), that my wardrobe would basically become a capsule wardrobe. However, I only bought two new bottoms: the gray ponte pants (second photo, bottom center) and the navy linen pants (first photo, definitely coming). I've been wearing the ponte pants at least twice a week since I got them. When I bought them, I intended on bringing them on this trip. But now I'm worried that they'll be too warm to wear in Barcelona/south of France in June. In the past I brought the button down tops and dresses. Either the navy/purple button down or the gray long sleeved merino (not pictured) has always been my plane top, but I need to change bottoms. Right now the linen pants are my top option, but I'd consider buying something or the ponte pants. Also, I've downsized the bag that I"}

Seeking Opinions on Repurposing Fast Fashion Brands into Custom Clothing I’ve been toying with an idea and would love to hear your thoughts. What if we took old, worn-out pieces from past fashion brands and gave them a new life? Imagine repairing and transforming those fast fashion brands and turning them into something entirely custom and unique. For example, turning a worn-out Patagonia jacket into a one-of-a-kind streetwear piece or revamping an old Zara denim jacket. The goal is to blend nostalgia with creativity, keeping the spirit of the original brand while making it fresh and wearable again. Would this concept interest you? Do you think there’s a market for this kind of sustainable fashion? I’d love to hear your opinions, suggestions, or even stories about your favourite old clothing pieces you’d like to see revamped!"}
