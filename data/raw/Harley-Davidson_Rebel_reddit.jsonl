My Dad, who is about as boomer as boomers can get. He was at my house one time and he was telling me about a raffle he bought tickets for. The winner would get a brand new Harley Davidson. The drawing was over the weekend he was visiting and they were supposed to announce the winner via email. He kept talking about how he wished he could check his email to see if he won. I told him he could use our desk top to check his email. He paused for a moment and looked perplexed. Then he says “how would my email be on your computer?” I tried to explain it to him but he just kept asking the same question over and over. “It doesn’t make sense” he’d say. “How could my email be on your computer?” I finally gave up and let him spend all weekend wondering if he won a Harley and why his son would think his email could be on his computer. Of course he didn’t win the Harley and no, he still doesn’t understand shit about fuck but he does love Trump. And no, he doesn’t have a smart phone."}

{"brand": "Harley-Davidson", "archetype": "Rebel", "source": "reddit", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/comments/xwc8jq/how_harleydavidson_saved_442_by_wasting_thousands/", "text": "How Harley-Davidson Saved $442 by Wasting Thousands, or: How To Lose A Customer Three years ago I purchased my first Harley-Davidson: A 2018 Heritage Classic 114. I wanted that deep, iconic V-twin rumble and I wanted to buy American. The fact that the bike is incredibly comfortable also played a significant role in my decision. A lot of people in the USA complain about job outsourcing and the lack of manufacturing in the country, and rightfully so. I try to put my money where my mouth is by supporting American brands - which is 50% of the reason I purchased a Harley-Davidson. In fact, I financed through them, joined Harley Owner's Group (HOG), and purchased all of my motorcycle insurance through Harley. I liked my Heritage Classic so much that, a couple years later, I decided to upgrade to a touring model - a 2022 Road Glide Limited. It was fantastic. I put 800 miles on it riding all over Southern California, including the Pacific Coast Highway. It was my second trip on the bike that proved to be disastrous. I was riding from Arizona to Texas, around 1,200 miles. Around 900 miles into the trip... my engine died. I was cruising 80mph (the posted speed limit) in the right lane of I-10 heading east. The motorcycle was fully stock and had just received its first oil change by Harley 800 miles ago. The motor abruptly dies while cruising on the highway and, of course, the motorcycle begins decelerating rapidly. I pull over to the side of the highway, in the middle of the Texan desert, to try and figure out what had gone wrong. After checking around the motor for signs or leaks, and attempting to restart the motorcycle to no avail, it was clear that the motorcycle was dead. Now I have a serious problem. Several of them, actually. I have a motorcycle that doesn't run, I'm 330 miles from my destination, it's 10:00 AM and mid-August in the hot Texan desert, and I need to be at work the next day. I called HOG membership services, Harley Owner's Group, and am quoted around $800 to tow my motorcycle to the nearest Harley dealer. I tell them to hold off on calling a tow company until I can speak to my motorcycle insurance roadside assistance. I call the number listed on my insurance card, and after going over the details I am told that they are sending a tow truck my way. I give my credit card information and they immediately charge me $442.50 for a 300 mile tow, which is reasonable. I am also told to wait for a text that will include the tow company's details and an ETA. I wait 30 minutes, receiving several texts stating \"we're still attempting to locate a suitable tow company\". I call back to find out that the first agent had gotten my cell number and email address wrong, and that their system showed my request as \"completed\". It was obviously not completed. So the second agent goes through all the details again, allegedly correcting the email and phone number, to then dispatch a tow truck. Another 30 minutes goes by and I still do not receive a confirmation text. So I call back again... same problems. This went on for hours - almost 5 hours, to be exact. If I had no asked to speak with a supervisor, who knows how long it would have taken, or if they ever would have bothered. I debated hitchhiking to the nearest town and renting something to tow the bike myself. Unfortunately, after calling every possible place and trying their websites, nothing was available or even open. I'm relatively new to Texas, and wasn't going to ask the one friend I have to drive 5-6 hours to pick my bike and me up. So my choices are now to wait for a tow truck or abandon the bike and figure out another way home. The tow truck did show up, however, at 3:30 PM and the motorcycle was loaded onto the flat bed by 4:00 PM. Then began the long, 300 mile drive to a Harley dealership that was relatively close to me (but it's still 1.5 hours away). Had the brand new motorcycle with ~1,700 miles on it not died, I'd have been home by 3:00 PM at the latest. I ended up making"}

My Dad used it for a little over 2 years before he was diagnosed with cancer. His health began declining and the bike sat unused in my parent's garage for ~4 years. He died last year, and my Mom decided to sell it. Because we dont know anything about motorcycles other than how to start one, my Mom reached out to the dealership she bought it from to ask if they would have a mechanic check to see if there was anything wrong with it (we know it starts, but it did sit unused for a long time). They agreed, and when my Mom brought it in, they said they might be interested in buying it back from her after their shop checks it out. So the bike stayed at the dealership for 13 weeks. My Mom called them a bunch of times to get the status of the bike and they kept giving her to run-around with vague excuses. I told her it was crazy to let them keep it that long, and that she needed to get it back ASAP. She called them told them she was just coming to get it, and all of a they said they want to meet with her tomorrow to discuss a price. To me, it seems they've been acting super sketchy. My Mom asked me to go with her, and I just wanted to have a good idea the value of the bike before going."}

My family has been closely tied to Harley Davidson for decades. As a kid, HD gear was half my closet, and posters and memorabilia lined our farm workshop. I think they look cool, and sound cool, and feel cool to ride. The business side has been a disaster as long as I can remember, but lately I'm feeling a little embarrassed by the brand. Im visiting the family in Wisconsin this week. My sister and I were out on some errands, and having recently received a pair of boots in the mail that were a size too big, I thought \"hey, might as well hit the dealership and see what they've got\". We walk in to Milwaukee Harley Davidson, and are immediately greeted by two teenagers in skimpy bikini tops who are offering us a bloody mary (in Wisconsin, serving booze is legal at 18). My sister immediately shot me a look that said \"is this the kind of shit your into?\" I know I've met old dudes at biker bars that would think that's a dream come true, but I'm in my mid-late 20's. We don't really roll that way, and it's hard to convince anyone you're not a creep if that's the kind of treatment the brand thinks you want. It doesn't help that the Milwaukee dealership *and* my home dealership in Boston are both immediately adjacent a strip club. The tough-guys-and-hot-girls aspect of the culture starts to seem pretty sleezy now that the average harley rider is 50+ years old. I could write a similar rant about the annoying treatment *inside* the dealership, but that's for a different thread."}

My usual riding includes daily office commutes, lots of weekend rides, and most recently, a 2,400 km ride across South India with my friends. From the day I was gifted this bike, I thought I had made a decision I wouldn’t regret. But now I wonder—did I put too much trust in the brand? Was it the feeling I got during the test ride that made up my mind too quickly? Either way, I rolled her out of the showroom in Kochi, excited for what was ahead. Now that I’ve ridden this bike almost every single day, I think I’m qualified to talk about it—not as a fanboy, not as a hater, just as an owner who has lived with it. Hopefully, the title makes it clear that this isn’t a praise post or a rant. Just an honest take on the good and bad of owning the X440. The Good Well, let’s just say—this bike evokes feelings. It’s not just a machine; it’s something that connects with you. At its core, it’s a simple long-stroke engine, the kind that should just do its job and let you enjoy the ride. But of course, we live in a time where simplicity isn’t enough. So, they had to slap on a bunch of electronics to make it feel ‘premium’—because why let a well-built engine speak for itself when you can have a screen tell you how premium your ride is? That aside, the grunt is real. The moment you twist the throttle, it pulls hard and clean, letting you squeeze through gaps in traffic without breaking a sweat. It has that low-end torque that makes city riding effortless, and on the highway, it just settles into a nice rhythm. It’s got that mechanical rawness that makes every ride feel engaging. You don’t just sit and ride—you feel every pulse of the engine, every vibration through the bars, reminding you that you’re riding something with character. But where this bike truly shines is out on good roads. I’ve taken it through Ooty, the winding gap roads of Munnar, and every moment was a blast. The sound of the exhaust echoing through the hills, the little whine of the single-cylinder 440 beneath me—it all came together in a way that made me fall in love with it. The moment you open it up, it just clicks—the engine, the road, and you. No distractions, just pure, connected riding. It makes you forget about everything else, keeping you fully present in the moment. Every twist of the throttle, every downshift, every slight movement of your wrist—it all feels just right. The Bad Everything has its price, or is it karma? Since the day I got the X440, I’ve been an active member of the owner community, seeing posts about issues—some minor, some serious. At first, I assumed many of them were just due to lack of proper maintenance, especially from newer riders. I even helped out where I could, sharing what I’d learned from friends and my own automotive interest. But then, I started facing issues myself. Now, I genuinely do understand—it’s a machine, issues will happen. I also get that it’s a first-gen product, issues will happen. And for those who’d ask, \"Why didn’t you just get a Japanese bike if you wanted reliability?\"—well, I trusted modern engineering and believed we’d come a long way from the days when machines breaking down was just part of the ownership experience. Turns out, maybe I was too optimistic. It all started after the first service. A simple clutch spring broke mid-commute on my way back from the office. Now, I wasn’t expecting a critical mechanical failure just a few thousand kilometers into ownership, but hey, it’s a bike—things happen, right? So there I was, crawling in 2nd gear (because the shifter had decided shifting wasn’t its job anymore) all the way to the service center. Funny part? The part took a full week to arrive, completely messing up my daily commute. And the follow-up? Absolutely terrible. I was frustrated, but again, \"New bike, things can happen,\" I told myself. So I let it slide. Then came the GOPD change—a "}

My route home goes through some city streets before turning on to a bike lane for almost the entirety of the rest of the way. I was on this small city street section going in between some construction which had made it one lane at that point. During this section I can keep up with the cars (even on my normal non electric bike) with not much issue as they don’t go that fast through the stop lights and traffic and construction. But here I was, minding my own business keeping up with the car ahead of me right before my turn and this motorcycle guy on his big Harley Davidson (tm) is tailgating me pretty hard and clearly trying to bother me. I just ignore him and start my left turn onto my bike lane street and as I do, he screams out at me “get the fuck out of the way ponytail faggot”. To me, I found it quite humorous and just kept going. I was wearing the most cis het outfit ever, my school branded polo, khaki pants, and my backpack and helmet. So the fact that he thinks to say that just because I have my hair in a ponytail? Quite amusing. I do have very pretty long hair, but I do try to keep it in a ponytail to avoid getting it in my face. I’d have to assume he was just annoyed that the streets are allowed to be used by bicycles and anything other than his Harley Davidson (tm) motorcycle. But that’s that, that’s my story of the day. How would you have handled it? Done anything differently? I feel lucky he didn’t try to clip my wheel with his motorcycle or get physical as he sounded very agitated."}
