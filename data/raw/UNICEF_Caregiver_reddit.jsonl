Something seems odd My childhood friend, whom I’ve known since we were three years old, has had trouble organizing his life since the pandemic. After some setbacks, he managed to get back on track and started studying while working with his father. He told me he met a girl online while playing \"Plato\" (a game), and I didn’t think much of it because he always made virtual friends. I stopped talking to him regularly for about three months due to my routine. When we resumed our conversations, he began to tell me more about this girl. At first, I was very receptive and believed him. This girl is from abroad (the USA). She skipped a few years of high school due to her intelligence. She speaks five languages. She graduated with the second-best GPA in oncology medicine from Harvard. She joined UNICEF and went on many missions around the world. All of this while being only 22 years old. She has a very rare blood type (Rh null), commonly known as golden blood. People with this blood type are at high risk during surgeries, which led to almost all of her family members passing away. She moved to our city for a supposed job opportunity and because she had been talking to him for a long time. I didn’t believe any of this story, but he spoke with incredible confidence and sounded frantic. Every time I questioned whether he was joking, he assured me he wasn’t. It turns out she had COVID recently, which triggered a heart problem, so she’s been confined to her home because she needs transfusions for some reason. My friend stopped going to work and studying, and even quit college. He distanced himself from everyone and rarely responds to messages. When he does, it’s to talk about her, his supposed girlfriend he met online. He says that he needs to talk to her all the time because, due to her condition, she is in danger of having a heart attack or something. Over time, he started saying stranger things, like that she was being harassed by people from the Plato community. These people would make fake screenshots showing him being unfaithful, and she chose to believe them. She made him believe that she had abandoned her lifelong friends because they were against him. He even mentioned that she claims to have some sort of power to predict deaths. He describes her as if she were a kind of genius or messiah. Once, I invited him to play Plato, and he agreed. I managed to talk to the girl via call and realized that he was indeed talking to another person. She didn’t seem brilliant at all. In fact, I suggested testing my level in one of the languages she supposedly speaks, and she pretended to lose the connection. My friend even changed his phone number because he believes her wealthy Russian ex-boyfriend will track him down. He also mentioned that she knows how to hack phone numbers and access bank accounts. He told a very macabre story about a murder of one of her family members that chilled me to the bone. He says that he met this girl and that they made out. They both told me in the call I mentioned before that they met each other in person. Something seems very odd. I’m losing my friend, and I don’t know what to do. I’m unsure if they want to take money from him or something worse. I don’t want to oppose him for fear that he might shut me out and stop talking to me. My friend was never a liar. I have known him since I was a child. Im doubting everything. I dont know if shes lying, if my friend is lying to me for some reason. I dont know what else to do to help my friend. What should I do? UPDATE: My friend and I went to his house without notifying him. His mother opened the door and told us that she had been thinking of contacting us because she is also very worried about her son. She shared more details with us. He sleeps all day, wakes up around 7/8 in the evening, and spends the whole night talking to this woman. We learned something that really alarmed us.

Most people here believe the opposite to be true, sharing some facts to break the myth(s).This is not to say that we shouldn’t demand better services especially our crumbling urban infrastructure but posts on this group just speak about how everything is falling apart in our country and things are just getting worse. While I agree the taxation on automobile (43% Tax + Cess), Insurance and EMI are actual pain points for an average Indian and should be reduced for vehicles and eliminated for Insurance and EMI. But by no means are we paying anything close to what Europeans pay in taxes. Let’s compare Germany with India as it has the highest Population in Europe Population (Cr): 8.5 Vs 144 Per Capita Income (USD): ~50k Vs ~2.9k Tax Payers (in Cr): 4.2 Vs 9.3 Working Population (in Cr): 4.6 Vs 97.0 Taxpayer % of Working population: 90%+ Vs ~9% Top 8% by Income: 6k Euro (5.5L INR) Vs 90k INR (According to World Inequality Database) Tax Paid by top 8%: 25% to 42% (vary for different Tax class) Vs 5% Is the India middle class really paying high taxes? Well according to different survey an India middle class is defined as someone earning between 6-18LPA you’re paying 12% tax on 18LPA. And you’re in top 3% if you make more than 25LPA and even then you pay close to 17-18% taxes. Anyone who pays close to 25% income tax, they need to earn close to 55LPA putting them easily in top 1% in India, and I don’t think that’s Tax terrorism by any means. We are a low GDP per capita country with close to bottom 65% households earning less than 5LPA (most of them are not on reddit) Now let’s come to the services like Africa part. Excluding SA as most when they speak about Services like Africa, don’t look at South Africa. Energy Consumption Per Capita: 391 kWh/yr Vs 1025 kWh/yr Rail network (in Kms): 58k Vs 68k Electrification of Railway %: 5% vs 93% Area Per Route Km: 1021 (avg) Vs 47 Road Network (in kms): 2.39M Vs 6.7MPaved Network (in kms): 727k Vs 4500k (30% Vs 67% of total network) Access Control (in kms): 1.3k Vs 5.5k Open Defecation in 2002: 21.9 Cr Vs 75.9 Cr Open Defecation in 2022: 19 Cr Vs 15 Cr (according to world bank) Swachh Bharat according to UNICEF reduced people without access to toilet from 550m to 50m in 5 Years. WHO reported at least 180,000 diarrhoea deaths were averted in rural India since the launch of the Swachh Bharat Mission Banking as % of population: 48% vs 78% (2021 data, must have improved for India) India went from close to ~10% of Adult population with bank accounts to ~80% in 2017 (according to BIS Paper Derryl D’SIlva , Zucana Filkova, Frank Pecker, And Siddharth Tiwari) % of &lt;10k INR transaction in 2017 - 3.5% Vs ~70% in 2021 (Moving from Physical collateral to Information Collateral) Internet penetration: 36% Vs 62.6% Share of Global Manufacturing: 2% Vs 3.3% Covid Vaccine % of population: ~52% Vs 88% While none of African countries have anything close to IIMs, AIIMs, NITs, IITs etc. Neither do they have anything close to UPI, OCEN, ONDC, Fastag, Digilocker, E-KYC, Jan Shan Accounts (70 Crore bank accounts) reducing leakages because DBT, Ayushmann Bharat (Insurance scheme with 70 crore enrolments), Mudra loans etc. And all this is done across party lines and credit goes to multiple leaders from different parties. On top of this India has to spend big on Defence because of hostile neighbours, recapitalisation of national banks in 2019 (over 2L crore because of NPA cycle of 2010-2014). Loss making PSUs, waivers for poor and farmers, lower corporate tax to be competitive in SEA for manufacturing.

I hope I'm wrong. First of all, he's got mad skills, and seems like a law-abiding pleasant enough man, and I'm sure that he'd be a great guy to have as a neighbor. I don't doubt that he will win. And I know he follows this feed, so maybe he can shed some light. But what's all this talk about being some kind of non-specific international humanitarian aid worker, and bringing his family to his job sites in the bush. And in this episode also having to keep secret about his work. It's been a while, but I'm returned Peace Corps, and for years worked for/with orgs includiing USAID, CARE Int., Médecins Sans Frontières, UNICEF and others. Staff that brought famlies, lived in the big cities, not the bush. And staff have defined skill sets such as education, agriculture, health care, or even administration. And also, there are no secrets in reputable NGOs, b/c you want the objective of the project to be beyond reproach. Ask anyone in the field, and they will openly tell you the specific objectives, geographic areas, demographics, timeline and funding like it's second nature. So i'm guessing missionary, with maybe extreme proselytizing. And it's the wild west out there with no rules. Any church can raise 30K and send someone to the bush to give \"aid.\" And while World Vision is bad enough, in my work I've encountered just scores of missionaries, with religious fanatics, that did a lot more harm than good. For example: Schools that require two or more hours of daily religious indoctrination at the cost of the ABC's,, teaching that condoms are a sin in areas of extreme poverty where maybe half the girls make money through prostitution, teaching that it's God's will that girls should have as many children as possible, trading food for baptisms, warning against vaccinations or medical care b/c it's against God's will....etc. And also **proselytizing in countries where it's illegal.** All in the name of humanitarian \"aid.\" In these cases the job-title missionary is much more appropriate than humanitarian aid worker. Moreover, these groups not only harm the direct recipients of the \"aid\" but also sincere aid groups, by tarnishing the reputations of aid efforts as a whole. And as far as the the \"aid\" worker themselves, half the time they love being in the bush, because it brings privilege and status to an otherwise very ordinary life, simply b/c you are a Westerner with some money. Remember, to a starving child, a man with a loaf of bread is a god. Timber: There's a picture of you with kids in the mountains of Afganistan. If the Taliban were to learn that you were there, are those kids and that village in danger from your \"aid?\" Maybe I'm totally wrong on this, and honestly I'd like to be wrong. So, please let me know cuz I'd like to cheer for you to win. Edit: Post script, rereading I realize I'm somewhat harsh on FBOs. In fact many of the FBO's have done great work. But generally those people will be open about it. Mormons, Adventists, and many groups will state that they are on mission, and then I'll ask if they want to get a beer to test their faith :-) It's the ones that are not open that are scary. Cuz the only closed off aid workers i've met are either missionaries or spooks, and I just can't see Timber as a CIA agent. Post-Post Script: After reading the comments I want to say that I am NOT attacking Timber's faith, or religion as a whole, or even Timber's overall character. I know that the TV show edits what they want us to see. I'm more concerned with the distinction of what is an International Humanitarian Aid worker, and whether that title is disingenuous. If Timber is a missionary, I respect that as long as his actions are legal and **secularly** ethical. However, from what I've learned about his work near the Afgan border, if the local governments knew of his purpose in translating the local languages is to print bibles, and that his group is smuggling Afgani's out of the country, th"}

I won't beat around the bush: I fucking love zombies. FUCKING LOVE THEM. I had considered posting this under r/zombies, but I didn't think it would get the serious consideration it deserved. I've played *Dead Rising*, *Left4Dead*, even schooled kids in *House of the Dead* arcade machines. I\"ve seen just about every zombie movie out there, watched AMC's *The Walking Dead* religiously and read Max Brooks' *World War Z* and *The Zombie Survival Guide* (in addition to the million or so other novel/novellas/graphic novels that exist). But IMO, there's still not a FPS that measures up to what fans of the genre expect. COD has already touched on zombies a little bit with World at War and Black Ops, and as much fun as it is, I wonder if a full-length-feature game centered around Z-Day couldn't be successful. Imagine if you will, the military scenarios that would present themselves if a Z-Day actually happened: I see battalion blockades in NYC, soldiers cornered, pinned down, forced to fight seemingly unending waves of zombies. The lines break, you and your team run, fighting through buildings, the streets, trying to get out of the city as the lines fall one by one. Maybe another perpective from another country in the campaign: A soldier in the Chinese Army stationed in a small village in rural China near the mountains. A strange sickness starts to spread, and pretty soon this small mostly farming community is overrun with the walking dead. You have to fight your way down to the river, steal a fishing boat, and get the hell out of dodge. There are so many possibilities: 7 continents worth of playable maps/situations that would be under attack in different ways/scenarios. I've noticed a lot of the Battlefield and COD franchise is centered in the Middle East (and a lot of people seem to either love it or are wishing for a change of scenery). What if the beginning of the campaign has you starting out as a soldier in war-torn Afghanistan or Iraq on a mission babysitting UNICEF workers as they help civilians injured in bomb strikes, landmine accidents, and military skirmishes? A young boy is brought in with a strange rash and labored breathing. You're stationed outside the tent with a couple of other soldiers (or mercs) when suddenly screaming erupts from inside the tent. The soldiers turn to see blossoms of blood bloom against the tent walls. You rush inside to find everyone inside is either dying, being eaten alive, or in the process of becoming a zombie. Your team tries to fight them off, but to no avail. You fall back to the outskirts of the Relief Zone but your ammo is low. It's down to just you and your buddy, back to back with your pistol, fighting off the town as they succumb to the chaos and seek you out, eager to eat your flesh. Eventually you are overrun; the first zombie bites into your arm, you knife him. The second knocks you down, the gun falling just out of reach. They're on you in seconds, biting, tearing, pulling you apart, eating you alive. The screen bleeds red and then blackness. You have just become the first casualties of World War Z. Cue opening credits... I think this would have people playing the campaign over and over again. You would be hard pressed to find someone not buying a FPS these days solely for the online competition, and campaigns have kind of fallen by the wayside (they're usually used as a learning device to get the player familiar with strategy and button configuration). If you had a successful, engaging game about fighting through the zombie apocalypse from the perspectives of people all over the world (with multiple expansion packs that could be released) I think people would play the SHIT out of it.

Something seems odd My friend keeps talking about this girl he met online. Something seems odd. My childhood friend, whom I’ve known since we were three years old, has had trouble organizing his life since the pandemic. After some setbacks, he managed to get back on track and started studying while working with his father. He told me he met a girl online while playing \"Plato\" (a game), and I didn’t think much of it because he always made virtual friends. I stopped talking to him regularly for about three months due to my routine. When we resumed our conversations, he began to tell me more about this girl. At first, I was very receptive and believed him. This girl is from abroad (the USA). She skipped a few years of high school due to her intelligence. She speaks five languages. She graduated with the second-best GPA in oncology medicine from Harvard. She joined UNICEF and went on many missions around the world. All of this while being only 22 years old. She has a very rare blood type (Rh null), commonly known as golden blood. People with this blood type are at high risk during surgeries, which led to almost all of her family members passing away. She moved to our city for a supposed job opportunity and because she had been talking to him for a long time. I didn’t believe any of this story, but he spoke with incredible confidence and sounded frantic. Every time I questioned whether he was joking, he assured me he wasn’t. It turns out she had COVID recently, which triggered a heart problem, so she’s been confined to her home because she needs transfusions for some reason. My friend stopped going to work and studying, and even quit college. He distanced himself from everyone and rarely responds to messages. When he does, it’s to talk about her, his supposed girlfriend he met online. He says that he needs to talk to her all the time because, due to her condition, she is in danger of having a heart attack or something. Over time, he started saying stranger things, like that she was being harassed by people from the Plato community. These people would make fake screenshots showing him being unfaithful, and she chose to believe them. She made him believe that she had abandoned her lifelong friends because they were against him. He even mentioned that she claims to have some sort of power to predict deaths. He describes her as if she were a kind of genius or messiah. Once, I invited him to play Plato, and he agreed. I managed to talk to the girl via call and realized that he was indeed talking to another person. She didn’t seem brilliant at all. In fact, I suggested testing my level in one of the languages she supposedly speaks, and she pretended to lose the connection. My friend even changed his phone number because he believes her wealthy Russian ex-boyfriend will track him down. He also mentioned that she knows how to hack phone numbers and access bank accounts. He told a very macabre story about a murder of one of her family members that chilled me to the bone. He says that he met this girl and that they made out. They both told me in the call I mentioned before that they met each other in person. Something seems very odd. I’m losing my friend, and I don’t know what to do. I’m unsure if they want to take money from him or something worse. I don’t want to oppose him for fear that he might shut me out and stop talking to me. My friend was never a liar. I have known him since I was a child. Im doubting everything. I dont know if shes lying, if my friend is lying to me for some reason. I dont know what else to do to help my friend. What should I do? UPDATE: My friend and I went to his house without notifying him. His mother opened the door and told us that she had been thinking of contacting us because she is also very worried about her son. She shared more details with us. He sleeps all day, wakes up around 7/8 in the evening, and spends the whole night talking to this woman. We "}

As you may be aware, there has been a group of people from Kakuma on our subreddits, and we've recently been made aware that multiple users from this subreddit (as well as other LGBT related subreddits) have been approached by people asking for donations to this \"group\" through private or direct messages. They are almost always new accounts with low karma and generic usernames claiming to be affiliated with the Kakuma refugee camp. We've been keeping track of this group for a while, and while we cannot be 100% sure on this matter, we have a growing suspicion that the people behind this campaign are trying to scam money out of us and our users. We've done some personal research into the matter by reaching out to people who do missionary related things in the area, to groups within the area, and other things as well, however we cannot connect them to these accounts, the crowd-funders, or anything else that they post. When they have made posts, when someone points out that they tend to look like a scam, they then delete their account, and any related information related to that account. Now, as we've said, there is a chance that this is not a scam, however our subreddit does not allow fundraising on it, for a number of reasons; such as not being able to 100% verify any user, the potential that donating could link your account to any personal information given, as well as it just not being a safe thing to do on the internet unless you know the organization or person running it very well. Our community is one that is often stricken by poverty itself, so we understand the want to help out the refugees there. We ask that you keep safe and act smart, that you don't donate to people you don't know, and that you keep your personal information secure. For those who would still like to give, we ask that you consider giving to a known charity resource, such as the following: * [UNHCR's Kakuma Information](https://www.unhcr.org/ke/kakuma-refugee-camp) * [Donation link](https://donate.unhcr.org/int/en/general) * [UN Refugees Information](https://www.unrefugees.org.au/our-stories/bright-future-in-kakuma-refugee-camp/) * [Donation link](https://www.unrefugees.org.au/donate/) * [Unicef Kakuma Information](https://www.unicefusa.org/mission/emergencies/child-refugees-and-migrants/kakuma-refugee-camp) * [Donation link](https://www.unicefusa.org/ways-donate) * [Rainbow Railroad Kakuma Information](https://www.rainbowrailroad.org/news/rainbow-railroad-and-oram-release-report-on-lgbtqi-refugees-in-kakuma-refugee-camp-kenya) * [Donation link](https://www.rainbowrailroad.org/donate) (Edit: I'll be adding other legitimate donation links as I find them 😎👍)"}

According to the note, published by the Embassy official website, Ambassador Richard Norland and UNICEF’s new Special Representative for Libya Abdulkadir Musse had an introductory call on Monday to discuss UNICEF’s important work in Libya. The meeting covered a wide range of issues facing children’s health and safety in Libya including vaccine shortages, safety of children migrants, monitoring and reporting on child soldiers, and Covid-19 response efforts. Ambassador Norland re-affirmed U.S. support for UNICEF’s efforts in the context of progress in Libya’s political dialogue and the reduction of violence following Libyan-led talks including the October 23 cease-fire declaration. The situation in Libya remained volatile throughout the 2020 with a conflict of variable intensity that continued to put the lives of civilians at risk and to generate new internal displacement. According to the UN body, in the Western Libya, deterioration of services and rapidly declining economy resulting in increased suffering of millions of children and their families in Libya that cannot be underscored. Since the start of the year, at least 18 schools have been damaged as a result of the armed conflict, affecting around 15,890 children. Continuous attacks on the water system have jeopardized health and hygiene among the civilian population, particularly those most vulnerable. At least 127 wells have been rendered out of services as a result of these attacks, with roughly a loss of 650,000 m3 water/day. Regular long hours’ power cuts have further affected the people of Libya in areas of active conflict and surrounding areas. In April and May 2020, the aggressive offensive by the Government of National Accord (GNA) militias to control Tripoli and western areas saw the Libyan National Army (LNA) withdrawing from the frontlines and as a result, approximately 28,000 people (5,550 families) including 11,000 children were displaced from Tarhouna, one of the strongholds of the LNA, with majority of them displaced to Benghazi, Ejdabia, and Bani Walid. Most of the IDPs moved with family members or rented houses, however, the authorities converted nine schools into IDP shelter centres to accommodate the IDPs from Tarhouna. Similarly, to accommodate the IDPs from Tarhouna, an additional nine schools were converted into IDP shelters in June 2020, thus, bringing the total number of schools used as IDP shelter centres to 345. The UN also reported of continuous violations of international humanitarian law after the withdrawal of the LNA from Tarhouna, where over 100 bodies including women and children were found in a hospital in Tarhouna. In addition, a large number of unidentified bodies were discovered in 11 mass graves in Tarhouna. The GNA, UNSMIL and UN Secretary-General condemned the discovery of these mass graves and urged for a prompt and transparent investigations by commissioning a ‘fact-finding mission’ by the UN Human Rights Council. The withdrawal of the armed groups from the Western Libya brought about a grotesque turn. Land mines, Improvised Explosive Devices (IED), and explosive remnants of war (ERW) have been found in and around civilian houses in Tripoli and western areas, putting populations on the move, especially IDPs and returnees, at significant risk. During May 22 to June 22, 2020, the Libyan Centre for Mine Action and War Remnants recorded a total of 127 victims from mine explosions in Tripoli and around Sirte, including 55 members of mine-clearing teams who were killed and injured during demining. On 28 May, UNICEF, together with the UNMAS and the LibMAC, condemned the use of IED/booby traps against civilians and their impact on children.

It´s taken me a few hours but I am finally done. Unfortunately, every time I try to post a pic of each of the 18 years, my post is deleted by Reddit. So here is only the summary and a couple more. All of this is available online through ProPublica. I have to admit I am impressed by Alec´s charity. I think it´s nice to give. I have to give him that. However, with that said, it is pretty obvious that some of Alec´s giving is paying to play. He has given a lot of money to the East Hampton Library and that helps to explain Hilaria´s presence and interview about her BS book. Their prime seats at US Tennis, well, he donates to the USTA, also the the NY Philharmonic, where he has a hosting gig. I am sure that some of the children´s visits to the Museum were facilitated by their parent´s donations. He gives money to his kid´s school and I suspect that St. Monica might be the church that his daughter attended in LA. Some of the giving is for PR after all his bad behavior, like the 2018 arrest for assault. He also gave a lot more money during his 30 Rock Years and it is understand that he gave ALL of the money he received from the Capital One ads (nearly $15 million) to charity. What is pretty obvious is that either Alec´s finances are strained or he has decided to spend more of his money on his familia. His donations have taken a steep dive after Griftmas and the onslaught of baby after baby. I have highlighted a few obvious donations but maybe you will find some interesting nuggets. I also pulled his 2024 and 2025 donations from his Foundation´s FB page. Another pepino provided an earlier report on Alec´s 2022 return (link below). I wanted to start from the beginning through today to get an idea of what he has done.

Something seems odd. My friend keeps talking about this girl he met online. Something seems odd. My childhood friend, whom I’ve known since we were three years old, has had trouble organizing his life since the pandemic. After some setbacks, he managed to get back on track and started studying while working with his father. He told me he met a girl online while playing \"Plato\" (a game), and I didn’t think much of it because he always made virtual friends. I stopped talking to him regularly for about three months due to my routine. When we resumed our conversations, he began to tell me more about this girl. At first, I was very receptive and believed him. This girl is from abroad (the USA). She skipped a few years of high school due to her intelligence. She speaks five languages. She graduated with the second-best GPA in oncology medicine from Harvard. She joined UNICEF and went on many missions around the world. All of this while being only 22 years old. She has a very rare blood type (Rh null), commonly known as golden blood. People with this blood type are at high risk during surgeries, which led to almost all of her family members passing away. She moved to our city for a supposed job opportunity and because she had been talking to him for a long time. I didn’t believe any of this story, but he spoke with incredible confidence and sounded frantic. Every time I questioned whether he was joking, he assured me he wasn’t. It turns out she had COVID recently, which triggered a heart problem, so she’s been confined to her home because she needs transfusions for some reason. My friend stopped going to work and studying, and even quit college. He distanced himself from everyone and rarely responds to messages. When he does, it’s to talk about her, his supposed girlfriend he met online. He says that he needs to talk to her all the time because, due to her condition, she is in danger of having a heart attack or something. Over time, he started saying stranger things, like that she was being harassed by people from the Plato community. These people would make fake screenshots showing him being unfaithful, and she chose to believe them. She made him believe that she had abandoned her lifelong friends because they were against him. He even mentioned that she claims to have some sort of power to predict deaths. He describes her as if she were a kind of genius or messiah. Once, I invited him to play Plato, and he agreed. I managed to talk to the girl via call and realized that he was indeed talking to another person. She didn’t seem brilliant at all. In fact, I suggested testing my level in one of the languages she supposedly speaks, and she pretended to lose the connection. My friend even changed his phone number because he believes her wealthy Russian ex-boyfriend will track him down. He also mentioned that she knows how to hack phone numbers and access bank accounts. He told a very macabre story about a murder of one of her family members that chilled me to the bone. He says that he met this girl and that they made out. They both told me in the call I mentioned before that they met each other in person. Something seems very odd. I’m losing my friend, and I don’t know what to do. I’m unsure if they want to take money from him or something worse. I don’t want to oppose him for fear that he might shut me out and stop talking to me. My friend was never a liar. I have known him since I was a child. Im doubting everything. I dont know if shes lying, if my friend is lying to me for some reason. I dont know what else to do to help my friend. What should I do? UPDATE: Ill give some more info so you can help me look up. Her name is supposedly Tattihane Fitzgerald"}

When Russia brings orphans from combat zones in Ukraine, an overwhelming Western propaganda apparatus portrays this as child abduction and a crime.** In April 1975, as the Vietnam War drew to a close, the US military transported several thousand children from Vietnam to the United States in Operation Babylift, according to official figures. The transport made headlines at the time because the first plane carrying Vietnamese children crashed near Saigon. Almost half a century later, in December 2021, CNN reported that the US military had brought 1,450 children from Afghanistan to the United States. A report that generated no more political attention than a traffic jam report or the weather forecast. I don't know how many children the US has transported in all its wars: from Latin America, Asia, and Africa, from the Balkans, Iraq, Libya, or Syria. According to media reports, more than 50,000 were transported in the Vietnam War alone, and there, as in other cases, many pious and less pious Christian aid organizations were involved. Not a single journalist from a major Western newspaper ever thought of referring to all these transports as \"child abduction\" or \"deportations.\" Quite the opposite. The protection of the defenseless has always been a precept of international humanitarian law. The Geneva Conventions regulate the protection of civilians, including children, in war. But this does not apply to Russia. When the Russian army evacuates parentless children and young people from Ukrainian combat zones, this cannot be considered a humanitarian action, because Russia, in the person of Putin, is devoid of any humanity and compassion. This twisted logic is clearly the basis of the propaganda fictions fabricated by numerous human rights NGOs and circulated in major Western media outlets since the beginning of the war. Most of these NGOs are not what their name suggests - namely, they are independent of government funding and pressure groups. Many are engaged in regime change where the West intends it. And this is becoming increasingly difficult to conceal. India has revoked the licenses of 15,000 (fifteen thousand) non-governmental organizations in recent years. The Russian government's detailed statements on the allegations of child abduction are either ignored by the major Western media outlets or condensed into two or three sentences, usually under the buzzword \"Moscow is denying it again.\" Russia is largely powerless against a massive Western propaganda machine that is pushing for military buildup and conjuring up a war against Russia. **“Putin the Child Catcher”** No sophisticated propaganda techniques were needed to fabricate the narrative about the \"deportation of Ukrainian children.\" The issue is simple. Children evacuated by Russian troops from danger zones on the front lines are usually registered as residents in Ukraine. As soon as a territory is occupied by Russian troops, children in that zone can be listed as \"disappeared\" and declared \"displaced persons.\" There are apparently no limits to narrative creativity when it comes to \"Putin the child catcher\" ([NZZ](https://www.nzz.ch/gesellschaft/russland-verschleppte-gezielt-ukrainische-kinder-ld.1778113)). Mykola Kuleba, government commissioner for children's rights in Kyiv, told the UN Security Council: \"More than a million children have ended up in the occupied territories of Crimea and Donbas and were deported to Moscow. They were stolen and turned into weapons. Thousands of them are now fighting against their homeland.\" The idea that the Russian government is kidnapping children from Ukraine to \"Russify\" them in educational camps, \"erasing their identity,\" and then sending them to the front as cannon fodder is constantly [circulating](https://globalchildren.georgetown.edu/posts/russia-is-turning-abducted-ukrai"}

I called Abble ($AABL) just a week before it pumped, now I'm calling Pawthereum ($PAWTH) | $480,000 donated to animal charities | Fully audited and KYCed I have the receipts to prove my crypto success. Check my post history and read the post titled “Moonshot Magic: 13 Keys to Meme Coin Success.” In that post I praised Abble for their community and for being a potential leader of the stock meta for meme coins. I predicted it would skyrocket, and a week later, its price shot up by over 1,600%. If you invested just $600 when I said to, you’d have an easy $10,000 now. I’m not here to flex - just saying I’ve got a proven track record for spotting winners. After breaking down my 13 Keys to Meme Coin Success (which I used to call Abble’s run), I’m now seeing similar indicators for Pawthereum ($PAWTH). This project combines the viral appeal of cat tokens with a strong foundation, and there’s real momentum building in its community. Plus, with renewed interest in animal-themed projects, the timing feels perfect. Pawthereum is also adapting to emerging crypto metas, recently launching a tokenized AI agent to help raise capital for their philanthropic efforts. Their adaptability to the crypto landscape is impressive. \\*\\*Why Pawthereum?\\*\\* Pawthereum’s doing incredible things that are still flying under the radar. Once more people realize their achievements, the cat’s out of the bag. A Pawthereum community member recently went to Geneva to join UNICEF on a panel to discuss crypto philanthropy and blockchain as a force for good. Many of the same patterns that triggered Abble’s success are showing up here. Strong “cat coin” vibes have worked well for other projects like POPCAT. \\*\\*Here's why Pawthereum has potential to be a leader of the upcoming cat coin meta:\\*\\* 1. Community-Driven: PAWTH’s community is passionate, growing, and already has made headlines in the previous bull run for their charitable efforts. 2. Charity-Focused: It's not just about profits here, folks. Pawthereum donates to animal shelters and rescues, giving it an actual use case that resonates with people. 3. Memetic Power: Cats have been meme lords since the dawn of memes. Just imagine the viral potential when people catch on to the narrative shift from dog to cat coins. 4. Cat Takeover: With all the major meme coin categories covered, the market is begging for something fresh. Cat coins are it. Look at the success of other animal-themed tokens. Now multiply that with the cultural dominance of cats. What is Pawthereum? Pawthereum is a cryptocurrency project with animal welfare at its core, with a mission to support animal shelters and be a digital advocate for animals in need. All too often, smaller animal shelters struggle financially, often overlooked and overshadowed by larger charitable organizations. Pawthereum was created to address this, aiming to become the leading disruptor of charitable inclusion by utilizing the advantages of blockchain technology to obtain funding, bypass the middleman, and donate directly to animal shelters around the world. This team has managed to donate around $480,000 to different charities and shelters, including the largest cryptocurrency donation ever made in Scotland’s history: $118,000 donated to Edinburgh Dog and Cat Home. A $100,000 donation was given to PAWS Wildlife Center, an amazing sanctuary, hospital, and rehabilitation center in Washington State, USA. A $50,000 donation to the Catherine Violet Hubbard Animal Sanctuary and many others! Pawthereum has already made a difference for many other shelters around the world: [https://pawthereum.com/charity-donations/](https://pawthereum.com/charity-donations/) Pawthereum is my next pick, but keep an eye on Abble too - it’s not done yet.

According to the DOH FB page, 66% of road accidents came from motorcyles, 94% of which ay di nakahelmet. Dahil diyan, Dr. Herbosa is looking into non inclusion of drunk driving to Zero Balance Billing. Thoughts on this doctors? I think it's good kung may laganap na awareness para mabawasan nadin mga di nakahelmet lalo na yung mga batang mahilig magresing resing at banking banking na parang ogag sa kalsada at yung mga lasing na pinipilit parin magmaneho kahit na di na makakita ng maayos but I can also see how these \"victims\" would look at it as \"injustice\" dahil \"may karapatan\" din sila dun. There would always be 2 sides of the coin."}

Something seems odd. My childhood friend, whom I’ve known since we were three years old, has had trouble organizing his life since the pandemic. After some setbacks, he managed to get back on track and started studying while working with his father. He told me he met a girl online while playing \"Plato\" (a game), and I didn’t think much of it because he always made virtual friends. I stopped talking to him regularly for about three months due to my routine. When we resumed our conversations, he began to tell me more about this girl. At first, I was very receptive and believed him. This girl is from abroad (the USA). She skipped a few years of high school due to her intelligence. She speaks five languages. She graduated with the second-best GPA in oncology medicine from Harvard. She joined UNICEF and went on many missions around the world. All of this while being only 22 years old. She has a very rare blood type (Rh null), commonly known as golden blood. People with this blood type are at high risk during surgeries, which led to almost all of her family members passing away. She moved to our city for a supposed job opportunity and because she had been talking to him for a long time. I didn’t believe any of this story, but he spoke with incredible confidence and sounded frantic. Every time I questioned whether he was joking, he assured me he wasn’t. It turns out she had COVID recently, which triggered a heart problem, so she’s been confined to her home because she needs transfusions for some reason. My friend stopped going to work and studying, and even quit college. He distanced himself from everyone and rarely responds to messages. When he does, it’s to talk about her, his supposed girlfriend he met online. He says that he needs to talk to her all the time because, due to her condition, she is in danger of having a heart attack or something. Over time, he started saying stranger things, like that she was being harassed by people from the Plato community. These people would make fake screenshots showing him being unfaithful, and she chose to believe them. She made him believe that she had abandoned her lifelong friends because they were against him. He even mentioned that she claims to have some sort of power to predict deaths. He describes her as if she were a kind of genius or messiah. Once, I invited him to play Plato, and he agreed. I managed to talk to the girl via call and realized that he was indeed talking to another person. She didn’t seem brilliant at all. In fact, I suggested testing my level in one of the languages she supposedly speaks, and she pretended to lose the connection. My friend even changed his phone number because he believes her wealthy Russian ex-boyfriend will track him down. He also mentioned that she knows how to hack phone numbers and access bank accounts. He told a very macabre story about a murder of one of her family members that chilled me to the bone. He says that he met this girl and that they made out. They both told me in the call I mentioned before that they met each other in person. Something seems very odd. I’m losing my friend, and I don’t know what to do. I’m unsure if they want to take money from him or something worse. I don’t want to oppose him for fear that he might shut me out and stop talking to me. My friend was never a liar. I have known him since I was a child. Im doubting everything. I dont know if shes lying, if my friend is lying to me for some reason. I dont know what else to do to help my friend. What should I do?"}
