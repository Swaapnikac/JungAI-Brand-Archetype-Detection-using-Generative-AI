My name is Rafael, and besides being one of the founders and president of our club, I am also part of a small group of people in the nation that is collaborating with the Tesla engineering team to test the preliminary beta release of Full Self Driving. My car drove me about 98% of the near 200 miles trip from the city of Sunrise to Cape Canaveral for this trip and back home. At the beginning of the video below, I show our arrival at the Titusville superchargers. During my collaboration with Tesla to test the Autosteer on City Streets features of the Autopilot suite (commonly known as Full Self Driving) I test the capabilities and report any issues I can identify to Tesla, and their Autopilot and Artificial Intelligence developers take note for fixing issues. This is the video of our club’s excursion for that day."}

That was then, however, and as the pace of innovation accelerates, the future for leading German car manufacturers becomes uncertain. With electric and autonomous vehicles, aspects such as software and user experience become important differentiators. Are BMW, Mercedes Benz (formerly Daimler) and the VW Group prepared to go head-to-head in this arena with new challengers such as Tesla, Polestar, Build Your Dreams (BYD) and perhaps Apple? The German automotive industry In Germany, 7.2% of all employees work in the automotive sector; 892,000 people are employed directly, 1.6 million indirectly, and a further 680,000 work in induced positions. In 2022 automobiles and automobile parts constituted 15.6% of all German exports (more than 245 billion EUR) and became Germany’s most exported goods. In the same year, over 2.6 million German cars were sold within Germany, and another 2.6 million were exported worldwide. Mercedes Benz, BMW, and the VW Group make up the majority of these figures: Mercedes Benz’s revenue was 150 billion EUR in 2022 , BMW clocked 23.51 billion EUR, and the VW Group (with its 12 brands) turned over 279.2 billion EUR. In terms of net profits, they made 20.5 billion, 18.6 billion, and 15.8 billion EUR respectively, and together they account for round about 10% of the DAX -listed companies’ market capitalization. No way around electric vehicles In recent years, Tesla’s arrival prompted many companies, managers, and stock market investors to predict dramatic disruption in the automotive sector. In response to this change in the market, German car manufacturers added several electric vehicles to their product fleets. According to the German magazine “Auto Motor und Sport”, 14,506 units of the electric brands of BMW, Mercedes Benz, and VW were first registered with the German Bundeskraftfahramt in December 2022. So, the German electric car industry is gaining steam. But they have a lot to lose if an unexpected player pulls the rug out from beneath their feet… Troublemaker from overseas The most popular electric car brand today is Tesla, in particular the Model 3, of which 9,566 units were first registered in December 2022. But while the focus remains on Elon Musk’s brand and uprising Chinese e-car manufacturers, the biggest potential threat to the German automotive and mobility industry could be Apple. Tim Cook’s motivation A 2.5 trillion USD company, in 2022 Apple made 394 billion USD in revenue, slightly more than half of which came from iPhone sales with 205.5 billion USD. Its average margins are 36.3% on products and 71.7% on services. It has declared 94 billion USD in profit every year for the last two years—a doubling of the 57 billion in profits declared in Q4 2020). Apple's total assets in the fourth quarter of 2022 ran to 352.8 billion USD. In the second quarter of 2023, Apple declared 112.9 billion USD in current assets and 332.2 billion USD in total assets. If Apple wants to grow into a 4 or 6 trillion USD company, it needs to reach beyond its existing markets into areas that offer the opportunity to significantly increase its value. And Apple already has a lot of experience manufacturing products on a global scale, using contractors while ensuring high quality gets delivered. With the right contractor(s), an Apple car would fit right into its global supply chain. Apple also has other advantages over companies like Volkswagen, BMW, and Daimler: a huge user base plus experience in software development and user experience (UX) design. Furthermore, Foxconn, one of Apple’s largest suppliers, announced it is ready to start producing electric vehicles in October 2022. Premium brand with large market share With Apple’s strong premium brand, it can ask customers to pay premium prices. An Apple car would reflect the brand philosophy, ensuring it resonates with the"}

To solve the problem of soul-destroying traffic, roads must go 3D, which means either flying cars or tunnels are needed. Unlike flying cars, tunnels are weatherproof, out of sight, and won't fall on your head. Tunnels minimize usage of valuable surface land and do not conflict with existing transportation systems. A large network of tunnels can alleviate congestion in any city; no matter how large a city grows, more levels of tunnels can be added."}

Top story in today’s edition… As Tesla’s share of the EV market gets ever tighter, I detail how the company has switched focus to disrupting energy suppliers. Elsewhere… Questions over Labour’s 2030 date, Ford electric van takes fastest time at Goodwood, and China plans to sell its leader’s car to UK drivers. As ever, open door policy, if you have any thoughts, please do get in touch via my contact details below or reply to this email. Summary… Elon Musk has been quietly growing his UK energy team as Tesla is poised to launch new supply services that will disrupt the status quo and enable ‘prosumers’ to benefit. Background: Tesla has long held ambitions to enter the UK energy market as a supplier, having first registered as a generator with Ofgem in 2020. However, it’s believed, unlike in the US, the firm’s executives have been slowed down by all the ‘checks and balances’ firms need to undergo to supply energy in Europe – which has only been tougher since the war in Ukraine. To date… Tesla’s primary products in the UK have been its vehicles – becoming the most popular models at several points – its Supercharger Network, and its Powerwall (a home battery storage system). Tesla also has started deploying large ‘Megapack’ battery storage systems in the UK. What will ‘Tesla Electric’ look like? Based on the US model, it will empower British households to become ‘mini power plants’ by enabling them to generate, store, and trade renewable energy. Users can store energy in their Powerwalls (or their cars), sell excess electricity back to the grid, or share it with neighbours. The rates and benefits will vary depending on the level of involvement by the household - a large enough network of homes could help the grid avoid falling back onto fossil fuel. In the US… homeowners can manage their entire system through an app, giving them control over their energy production, storage, and participation in real time​. Importantly, it is not just for ‘Tesla fans’ and in the US non-Tesla product owners can sign up too. See their page here . Screenshots of the Tesla Electric app in the US Why now? Across the globe, Tesla has started to lose its lead on EV sales. Yes, there has long been a promise of an affordable vehicle, but this still seems distant. In the face of increasingly intense competition, such as from China, it seems Tesla has decided instead to double down on energy. Only yesterday, Bloomberg reported “Musk now views Tesla as more of an AI, robotics and sustainable energy company than an EV company.” Last year… It seemed Tesla was getting close to launching, as the company registered ‘Tesla Energy Ventures’ on Companies House in February 2023. Later in July, Tesla then advertised for a ‘ Head of Operations ’ for Tesla Electric UK. One of the tasks for applicants would be to work with Ofgem to get the relevant licences to supply energy to homes and commercial properties. New hire… It took them a while but, according to LinkedIn, last month Tesla appointed Roxanne Inskip-Kaye to the role. Roxanne previously held senior roles at other UK energy firms, including Social Energy and Ecotricity. And she seems to have had plenty of experience dealing with the UK's energy regulator – online records suggest she’s previously crossed paths with James Crump (Head of Smart Metering) and Rachel Clark (Deputy Director, Retail Systems and Processes) at Ofgem as part of a working group . More vacancies… And it’s not just Roxanne. In the UK, Tesla is advertising for seven roles within its energy teams, particularly for those deploying Powerwall and energy storage. Elsewhere, Tesla’s Texas-based Vice President of Tax, Joseph Gruber, was appointed to Tesla Energy Ventures Limited in March.
