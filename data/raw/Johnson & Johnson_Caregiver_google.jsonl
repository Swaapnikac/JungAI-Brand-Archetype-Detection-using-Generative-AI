Our Credo has been a guiding light for our entire organization for the past 75 years. Through periods of immense change, it clearly conveyed a set of values that influenced not only what we needed to achieve, but also the actions we needed to take to reach those achievements. At the same time, Our Credo is a living and breathing document. It’s both timely and timeless. Several times over the years, we’ve revised it slightly to ensure it remains just as forward-thinking as the day it was introduced. For example, in 1979, wording was added to outline the company’s responsibility to “protecting the environment and natural resources,” which reflected larger changes in the world at that time, including growing awareness about the environment . Our Credo displayed at Johnson & Johnson’s New Brunswick, New Jersey, headquarters In 1987, the last time changes were made, the word “fathers” was added to accompany “mothers” in the first paragraph, and a nod to work/life balance was included with the addition of this sentence: “We must be mindful of ways to help our employees fulfill their family responsibilities.” These updates were a recognition of changes in society and the workforce—more and more women were working , and there was a rise in two-career families. Each time Our Credo has been updated, it has reflected the changing world in which we live and operate. What’s never changed, though, is the role it plays in guiding our company decisions at every level, and that’s an important distinction—this is not a decision that was made solely at the leadership level. Last year, we enlisted our Executive Committee members to host small focus groups with over 2,000 employees across all of our regions, functions, levels and sectors. During these conversations we asked them: What does Our Credo mean to you? How can we make sure it’s relevant not just for today, but also tomorrow? We invited these employees to suggest any changes they felt would better reflect the times we live in to ensure Our Credo’s future impact as a guiding document. After these small-group conversations, we came back together as an executive team to review the employee feedback, and after thoughtful debate and discussion, I believe that the time is right to update Our Credo to reflect the needs of a new world, and solidify our commitments to the health of humanity over the long term."}

Among some of the more memorable updates: In 1979, wording was added to outline the company’s responsibility to “protecting the environment and natural resources,” which reflected larger changes in the world at that time. “The modern environmental movement had begun with the publication of Rachel Carson’s book, Silent Spring , in 1962, and the first Earth Day was held in 1970, so there was a growing awareness of the need to protect the environment,” explains Gurowitz. In 1987, “fathers” was added to accompany “mothers” in the first paragraph, and a nod to work/life balance was included with the addition of this sentence: “We must be mindful of ways to help our employees fulfill their family responsibilities.” These updates “were a recognition of changes in society and the workforce—more and more women were working and there was a rise in two-career families,” says Gurowitz."}

This was long before people spoke of “corporate social responsibility.” Our Credo is the moral compass that guides our responsibilities as a citizen of the world.

Our Credo is a living document and is reviewed to make sure that it meets the needs of our patients, the public, our employees, our communities in which we live and work and our stockholders. However, the spirit of the document remains the same today as it was when it was first written in 1943. Our Credo: We believe our first responsibility is to the patients, doctors and nurses, to mothers and fathers and all others who use our products and services. In meeting their needs everything we do must be of high quality. We must constantly strive to provide value, reduce our costs and maintain reasonable prices.

While I travel frequently, it is always a great experience to see the work of our international employees and partners firsthand, and to see our company Credo in action. My visit to one of those partners, the Medical & Surgical Skills Institute (MSSI) in Ghana, was one of the highlights of my trip. Participants in a suturing class in Ghana According to data from Vanderbilt University Medical Center, 5 billion people —particularly in low-income and lower-middle-income countries—lack access to safe, affordable surgical and anesthesia care. And while Ghana , on average, does better than most countries in making surgery available to people who need it, it’s always crucial to keep training new health workers to help maintain the skills of people working in surgical settings. In fact, ensuring that more people around the world have access to essential surgical care is a major component of Johnson & Johnson’s commitment to the 2030 UN Sustainable Development Goals . To date, more than 10,500 healthcare providers have received critical skills training from MSSI, which gets supplies and funding from Johnson & Johnson. A commitment to help improve surgical training in Africa For more than 10 years, the company has partnered with MSSI to provide life-saving surgical training to doctors, nurses and other healthcare providers in Ghana and throughout sub-Saharan Africa. To date, more than 10,500 healthcare providers have received critical skills training from MSSI, which gets supplies and funding from Johnson & Johnson. During my visit, I was able to observe a suturing class for nurses and midwives who came from all over Ghana, including many rural areas outside the capital of Accra. Their commitment to learning was clear: They were excited to improve their skills in a hospital setting, and looked forward to returning home to better serve their patients and share what they’d mastered alongside other nurses and midwives . All over the world, the Credo is a force for good, driving us to ensure we make a difference in the communities in which we work around the world. My trip confirmed for me that Johnson & Johnson has an exciting opportunity to grow in sub-Saharan Africa and meet the significant burgeoning surgical—and overall healthcare—needs there for years to come."}
