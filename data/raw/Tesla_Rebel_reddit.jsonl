{"brand": "Tesla", "archetype": "Rebel", "source": "reddit", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTesla/comments/1jfphxt/teslas_financial_death_spiral_in_10_points_my/", "text": "Tesla‚Äôs Financial Death Spiral in 10 Points (My Understanding) 1. **Tesla thought of itself as \"the Apple of cars.\"** Why do people line up for Apple products on launch day? Because they know Apple doesn't cut prices later, so there‚Äôs no advantage in waiting. If you wait, you miss out on being part of the story. Elon Musk expected Tesla to follow the same model. He believed customers would willingly pay premium prices, trusting that their cars would hold their value for years. And for a while, it was true. 2. **Tesla built its entire financial model around stronger than resale values.** They leased and financed many vehicles themselves, planning to resell them after leases ended at high prices. From an accounting perspective, Tesla owns tens or even hundreds of thousands of cars, which it records as valuable assets on its balance sheet. They then leverage these assets to secure loans, relying heavily on the assumption that these assets would maintain their value. 3. **But competition increased, and Tesla started cutting prices.** Unlike Apple, Tesla started cutting prices to boost sales. This encouraged customers to delay purchases, expecting future discounts rather than buying immediately. For Reddit mods, here is another analogy (joke): People buy Nintendo games at launch because they know waiting won‚Äôt get them a better deal. Steam, on the other hand, runs massive sales all the time, so people hold off on buying games until prices drop. Nobody wants to be the sucker who paid full price right before a discount. 4. **These price cuts severely damaged the resale value of used Teslas.** For example, if a new Model Y suddenly dropped from $60,000 to $55,000, the resale value of older Teslas immediately fell as well. Why would someone pay a high price for a used car if a new one is only slightly more expensive? 5. **Tesla‚Äôs brand then became increasingly stigmatized due to Elon Musk‚Äôs actions.** Here is where the downward spiral begins. Musk‚Äôs controversial public behavior, including gestures resembling Nazi salutes, provocative political statements, and polarizing opinions, made owning a Tesla socially uncomfortable for many average buyers. 6. **This stigma pushed Tesla owners to rush to sell their cars.** Some owners experienced vandalism, such as swastikas painted on their cars, or even arson attacks. At best, Tesla owners might get disapproving looks or comments, leading many to sell quickly, even at significant financial losses. Normies don't want to deal with the stigma, so they are OK making a loss. 7. **As a result, the used car market is now flooded with cheap Teslas.** Because so many owners urgently want to sell, platforms like Kijiji have become overloaded with heavily discounted Teslas. This oversupply creates a race to the bottom, further depressing prices. 8. **Tesla itself is now financially trapped.** Remember, Tesla still owns tens or even hundreds of thousands of these cars through their leasing program. Imagine that Tesla originally assumed a leased Model Y would be worth around $35,000 after three years, according to their financial projections. Now, however, the market values that same car at closer to $25,000 or even less. 9. **Every car sold below Tesla‚Äôs original projection creates direct financial losses.** If Tesla loses roughly $10,000 on each returned leased vehicle because it's worth far less than expected, these losses quickly multiply into billions of dollars across their portfolio. And at some point, they will have to report that loss to investors. 10. **Tesla is now caught in a dangerous financial death spiral.** The more stigmatized the brand becomes, the cheaper used Teslas become. As used car prices continue to fall, Tesla must cut new car prices even further to compete. Why would someone buy an expensive new Tesla when the market is flooded with cheap used ones? Lower prices for new cars push used car prices even lower, perpetuating the cycle. On top of this, Tesla secured loans against the v"}

Combat Gameplay team here to talk about the near future of Destiny abilities tuning. It‚Äôs been a very busy year with a lot of change in the abilities sandbox‚Äîthe Subclass 3.0 conversion of Void, Solar, and Arc, followed up by the brand-new Strand subclass‚Äîso we‚Äôre taking this opportunity to evaluate the state of our subclasses and systems, focusing on adjusting abilities that are either overshooting or not quite hitting our power bar. Today we‚Äôll be going through an update to Fragment slot allotments on a selection of Aspects, PvE-focused improvements to roaming Supers, and general balance updates across our subclass suite. With Season 21‚Äôs ability tuning pass, these are our high-level goals: * Increase viability of roaming Supers in high-difficulty PvE content. * Incorporate subclass keywords into a selection of Light subclass Supers. * Reduce the amount of unlimited uptime mobility available in the Crucible. * Increase buildcrafting capabilities of a selection of Stasis and Light subclass Aspects. Let‚Äôs get into it. [Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/bltc711dce7b1670f7b/64517cf1e7d018114c01cb80/230502_SA_Ability_Filler_Asset.jpg) ###FRAGMENT BUDGET REVIEW Over the last year, we‚Äôve consistently heard feedback that single-Fragment-slot Aspects feel restrictive to player buildcrafting freedom. Fragment slots are a critical balancing lever that we intend to continue to use to control Aspect potency, but we don‚Äôt feel that any of the current single-Fragment-slot Aspects are overperforming to the point of restricting them to a single slot, and so with Season 21 we‚Äôre increasing them to two. To set expectations now, we are not committing to a minimum budget of two Fragment slots for future Aspects, and we may change these slot allotments in the future. As we monitor the affected Aspects‚Äô performance following this change, additional updates to their potency level should be expected. * Increased the Fragment slot allotment for the following Aspects from 1 to 2: * Hunter * Trapper‚Äôs Ambush * Shatterdive * Gunpowder Gamble * Titan * Bastion * Juggernaut * Warlock * Chaos Accelerant [Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/blt748baeb8b01bdaf6/64517d56d5d03c0794f169c9/5_2022_Season_of_the_Seraph_PressKit_Story_Intro_COMPRESSED_008.jpg) ###SUPER TUNING UPDATES With Lightfall‚Äôs release came two new roaming Supers, Silkstrike and Bladefury. The tuning on these Supers was an experiment to determine where we felt roaming Supers could live in the combat sandbox. We‚Äôre pretty happy with the results, and with Season 21 we‚Äôre taking a pass at other roaming Supers (as well as some underperforming burst Supers) to increase their viability. While there is too much nuance in the Destiny sandbox to completely equalize the performance of something as diverse as our suite of Supers, our hope is that this puts them on a more level playing field. One of the ways we‚Äôre working to increase that viability is through damage resistance. In addition to the damage resistance values that Supers have against other players, all Supers have additional intrinsic damage resistance against PvE combatants, which we‚Äôre increasing. With this change, our goal is that Supers‚Äîin particular melee Supers‚Äîare more easily able to engage with targets in high-difficulty content. * All Supers * Increased PvE damage resistance by ~20%. In our initial Subclass 3.0 conversion we opted not to include subclass keyword integration (e.g. Jolt, Scorch, etc) into most Supers, but now that the dust has settled, we are revisiting that idea. With Season 21, we‚Äôre taking a pass at the roster and adding intrinsic keyword behaviors where their inclusion makes sense. Unlike existing interactions such as Arc Staff with Lethal Current, or Sentinel Shield with Controlled Demolition, these will be baked into the"}

I'm going to distill my key learnings and experiences here, in an attempt to educate others on EVs and reach some form of closure. My ownership could best be summed-up as a love/hate relationship, ending with crazy used car values offering me the out I'd been quietly seeking. Clearly, I decided EVs aren't for me - at least, not yet. I'm not a \"paid big oil shill\" or someone who's trying to short the stock, as I'm sure some of the Tesla nuts will claim. I'm just a car enthusiast (disclaimer: not an engineer) standing at the same crossroads as the rest of you, wondering what sounds future children will make long after (if?) our beloved bureaucrats outlaw the ICE. Everything I'm writing here is based on my own unique tastes and preferences. How the pros and cons balance out at the end is entirely up to you. And that's fine. Choice is great. Note that this post centers on Battery EVs (BEVs) at the time of this writing, which comprise the vast majority of EVs on the road today. And yeah. This got way longer than I anticipated. But it was cathartic for me and I hope it's at least somewhat useful to someone out there. # EV performance &amp; its accessibility I'll start with what ultimately sold me on the car - **Immense, instant power.** The war in the \"pure acceleration\" category is pretty much over - just take a look at Jason Cammisa's video with the Model S Plaid vs. the BMW M5 CS and Cadillac Crazy. They're not even on the same planet. Not only is the acceleration brutal, but it's consistent (everything else held constant - more on that later). Look up any number of 0 - 60 videos on YouTube, and you'll notice that the times are all remarkably close, especially if there are multiple runs in the same video. And how could they not be? Software and traction control are fundamental to EV operation. Adjustments take mere milliseconds. The amount of \"stuff\" involved between your right foot and the tires is a joke compared to an ICE car. And it's basically idiot-proof - even with the Track Mode dialed to 100% hoon in my TM3P, it was nearly impossible to make a mistake. You just put your foot down and the car takes care of the rest, with literally zero drama. # Electric motors are great And all of this performance comes with no mechanical sympathy. I never felt an ounce of it, flogging my Model 3 - there's really nothing to \"break\" mechanically in the way of the drivetrain. The entire drive unit consists of the motor, a few gears, the diff, a pump to circulate the oil... and that's really about it. No fried clutches, exploding transmissions, shredded differentials, etc... it's always ready to pounce at any speed, in any situation. Electric motors themselves are relatively inexpensive, quiet, clean, tough, extremely efficient, insanely long-lasting, and have an excellent power/size ratio. When it comes to to the task of turning energy into mechanical force, I'm not sure there's anything better. AND! You don't even have to worry about getting the motors up to operating temperature before you get on it. During the colder months, it easily takes 10+ minutes of highway driving for the oil of an ICE to warm up (you are looking at your oil and not the coolant temp, right?). I quite enjoyed leaving my neighborhood with the ability to give it full \"throttle\" right out of the gate. It's like teleporting straight into any 3-car gap, no matter where. (But there are limitations to this - more on that later, too.) # Convenience &amp; running costs You can also have your cake and eat it, too! There's no need to feel like a moron with a 550 HP ICE engine idling under the hood in daily stop and go traffic. My TM3P was an efficient, calm, quiet, easy, comfortable way of getting from Point A to Point B while being more similar performance-wise to a BMW M3 than a Toyota Corolla - with fewer running costs than either."}

But instead of just jumping in impulsively, I wanted to take a step back and explore the broader implications of what‚Äôs happening with Tesla and the U.S. market as a whole.

That‚Äôs not up for debate in my view. The real question is when it‚Äôs going to come back down to earth. I think some of the hardcore short sellers may have shown up too early to the party. Yes, they‚Äôre making noise and causing some damage, but it‚Äôs still early days. The key reason?

That‚Äôs the stage where the stock experiences one final upward thrust before demand dries up and the markdown phase begins. We won‚Äôt be able to confirm this until after the fact, but this setup suggests there may still be one last upswing before reality sets in. And let‚Äôs not forget how easily Elon and Trump can manufacture short-term narratives to keep the hype train rolling. For example: 1. Elon announces a new, cheaper model with an overly optimistic delivery timeline. 2. Trump announces plans to transition the federal vehicle fleet to Teslas. 3. A surprise decision is made to standardize all federal charging stations to Tesla‚Äôs NAC. 4. Suddenly, a new mandate appears‚Äîevery automaker must adopt the NAC standard ‚Äúby tomorrow.‚Äù 5, Tesla remains the only EV maker eligible for tax credits, while competitors lose out. All hypothetical, of course‚Äîbut not far-fetched. These kinds of announcements, even if temporary or empty promises, are more than enough to juice the stock price and keep hope alive a little longer. But here‚Äôs the thing: this won‚Äôt work in the long run. The brand itself is becoming radioactive. Tesla is quickly approaching the kind of cultural toxicity we associate with names like ‚ÄúAdolf‚Äù or the toothbrush mustache. No matter how much mental gymnastics some bagholders perform, you can‚Äôt deny the rot underneath. The company has shown no real innovation, has no competitive moat, and has been delivering nothing but negative headlines for months. 1. Tesla's stock has experienced a significant decline of nearly 50% in three months, reducing its market capitalization from an all-time high of $1.5 trillion to $845 billion.

Predictable as a trip to the toilet the morning after a heavy meal, and about as meaningful.* Bought our Model 3 shortly after Mohammed Bin Saud had Jamal Khashoggi butchered alive. That was the ‚Äúlet‚Äôs see if we can stop buying oil‚Äù moment in our family. And it worked! Car was great: cheap to fuel, low maintenance, easy road trips. When we bought it there was a real risk of bankruptcy, so it was great to survive that and learn that we love EVs and expect to drive them forever. Musk acted the fool and was clearly a shyster about FSD but at the time that was a sideshow, and the establishment of a credible EV market was appreciated. We paid off the car, didn‚Äôt send Tesla any more money besides the occasional supercharging fee, and ignored the weird stories. We had planned to hold the car for another 2-4 years and then trade in for something newer. A few years ago as he went bananas during COVID we were convinced that a new Tesla was not an option. But still the decision to sell was years away. Then he became a Nutzi and began doing everything you see now. We kept our heads down, not really in the market for a new car and long since done with supporting Tesla in any meaningful way. Still didn‚Äôt expect to sell anytime soon. Last week it hit me: The resale market and eventual trade in value for this car could fall off a cliff at any time. There‚Äôs no telling what lunatic antics Musk could further debase himself with. Our car could become completely unsellable - as customers reject the brand at all levels. The dealers we visited confirmed this - they have been flooded with Tesla trade ins here (SoCal). The secondhand market is ballooning and it remains to be seen if there‚Äôs any demand. We traded in for a car with real suspension (yay!) Apple CarPlay (yay!) and no affiliation with Elon Musk (double yay!). It outperforms our old car in every metric - no surprise there - and at sticker price lower than we paid for the Model 3. If you‚Äôre on the fence about selling my advice is this: There are great deals to be had everywhere, the competition has fully eroded Tesla‚Äôs original advantage, and it‚Äôs not very expensive to make the swap. tl/dr: Traded in our Tesla for a competitor with better features. Affordable and highly recommended. edit to add - I know it would be more helpful to hear about what we got instead of the Tesla but for various reasons I am not able to do that. We bought a competitor EV. Our new car is bigger, with more range*, and cheaper than what we paid for the Model 3. We got $22k in trade and paid an additional $2.5k cash. *We got the novelty ‚ÄúMid Range‚Äù Model 3 which existed for about 6 months. It was always the ugly duckling on range, which didn‚Äôt affect us much, but it means getting a car with more range was pretty easy for us to find."}

So if you're looking for visual aids, you‚Äôll need to do a bit of homework and look up the references and data I mention here. Trust me, it‚Äôs worth your time. Also, there will be no TL;DR at the end of this post. If you‚Äôre someone who can‚Äôt‚Äîor won‚Äôt‚Äîread through a detailed explanation, then this probably isn‚Äôt for you. The economy, and the factors that influence how a stock moves, are complex. If you're not willing to engage with that complexity, you‚Äôre setting yourself up to get burned. So, with that said, let‚Äôs dive in. u/[Worth-Initiative7840](https://www.reddit.com/user/Worth-Initiative7840/) wrote \"You don‚Äôt need the analysis bruv, 70% of Teslas profits last year were selling credits and interest on cash on hand‚Ä¶.they don‚Äôt make any money selling cars ‚Ä¶ the hype lie has been AI and new growth businesses in the company but that‚Äôs PT Barnum three card Monty bs - current fundamentals take out all the bs - it‚Äôs Ford.\" This comment caught me by surprise because the numbers were totally made up. I have to go back and do some research because what he said wasn't true at all. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Tesla's net income was $2.31 billion on revenues of $25.7 billion. During this period, the company earned $692 million from selling automotive regulatory credits. This revenue from regulatory credits represents approximately 30% of Tesla's net income for the quarter. [https://www.statista.com/statistics/1553187/revenue-of-tesla-regulatory-credits-by-quarter/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1553187/revenue-of-tesla-regulatory-credits-by-quarter/) Tesla reported a 47% increase in 2024, totaling $1.57 billion for the year, up from $1.07 billion in 2023. While the exact figure for Q4 2024 isn't specified, if we assume the increase was evenly distributed, the quarterly interest income would be around $392.5 million. This would account for approximately 17% of the quarter's net income. Combining both regulatory credits and estimated interest income, these sources contributed approximately 47% of Tesla's net income in Q4 2024. The 70% is false information. [https://www.captide.co/insights/tesla-q4-2024](https://www.captide.co/insights/tesla-q4-2024) Now let's talk about sale of regulatory credits. These are *not actual cars sold*‚Äîthey're a kind of *bonus revenue* Tesla earns because of how environmentally friendly its cars are. Governments around the world, especially in places like California and Europe, require automakers to sell a certain number of low-emission or zero-emission vehicles. If a car company doesn‚Äôt meet those requirements, they have to *buy credits* from companies that exceed the standard‚Äîlike Tesla. Tesla earns a bunch of these credits because all its cars are electric. Then it sells them t"}

A comprehensive analysis using the data this sub has accumulated over the last 18 months This is going to be a long one. This analysis contains no memes, no hype dates, no cryptic tweet analysis, and minimal speculation based on known market mechanics. This is a cumulative fact-based report of what we know to-date. The abstract is the closest you will get to a TLDR. This is *The GameStop Market Hedge Thesis*. ##Abstract GameStop is primed for the biggest short squeeze the market has ever seen. **The January 2021 ‚ÄúSneeze‚Äù** section uses SEC reports to show that short covering was a small fraction of the buy volume in the sneeze. Massive short positions are open and hidden in ETFs and swaps which don't have to be reported. **Current Market Conditions** is speculative but shows strong signs of an impending recession and/or market downturn. **The GameStop Squeeze is Inevitable** shows the company is in good health and at no risk of bankruptcy. Borrow and utilization rates prove the stock is illiquid and hard to find. Negative beta is a strong indicator that GameStop tracks inverse to the market which is headed for a major downturn. Even with current reported SI and no hidden short positions GameStop is primed to move many multiples above its current market cap. ComputerShare DRS statistics provide proof of a closing exit for shorts to squeeze out of, day by day making it harder for them to close their positions entirely. _________________ #Why Short Squeezes Happen ##Prime Short Squeeze Conditions &gt;Short interest ratios tend to be quite low; for large non-financial stocks, they are often less than 2.5% whereas for small non-financial stocks they still tend to be less than 13%. **Few stocks, if any, have short interest greater than 50% on a given date.**^(76) Until recently, short interest of more than 90% was observed only a few times‚Äîin 2007 and 2008. When examining short interest as a percent of shares outstanding, **GME is the only stock that staff observed as having short interest of more than shares outstanding in January 2021.** [[SEC.gov Staff Report on Equity and Options Market Structure](https://www.sec.gov/files/staff-report-equity-options-market-struction-conditions-early-2021.pdf)] &gt;**Short squeezes tend to occur more often in smaller-cap stocks, which have a very small float** (supply), but large caps are certainly not immune to this situation.

I can't really accurately state in a title sentence how much of an impact this had to the apes, see for yourself in this post. **Background** r/Superstonk is a subreddit revolving around the GameStop (GME) stock, in the briefest possible explanation, the redditors (self described as **apes**) have a theory that as long as they keep buying and never selling the company's stock, the stock will eventually become worth billions of USD per individual stock. Ok, you think that sounds unrealistic and sounds a lot like cryptocurrency financial armageddon? Well, that's the outlook required to understand the fanaticism and conspiratorial thinking you're about to see. Some apes think that GameStop will do a turnaround play to be valued like the equivalent to Apple, but this is already seen as a soft-schism as redditors are tired of not seeing massive gains after 3.5 years. The CEO billionaire of GameStop, Ryan Cohen, has generally been seen as the [individual working behind the scenes through the power of 4D chess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGdhHwsAhb0) in ensuring the redditors get paid. His tweets are practically quoted as scripture for the apes to follow, for instance, you'll see a lot through this post about how \"ape no fight ape\" is supported on an interpretation of a few tweets, such as [\"The hell with the left and the right. Stop dividing the people üíú\"](https://x.com/ryancohen/status/1536396937338970112) Of course, with anyone familiar with this kind of thinking, it's far more likely he can be identified as a yellow libertarian, such as his views on [covid vaccination](https://np.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/13exo28/ryan_cohen_on_twitter/), [his view on \"insurrectionists\"](https://np.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/vec4p5/ryan_cohen_tweet_power_to_the_players/), posing with [Javier Milei, president of Argentina](https://np.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1c133w8/ryan_cohen_ryancohen_on_x/), and now, 20 minutes after the shooting of Donald Trump, [Trump 2024 üá∫üá∏](https://x.com/ryancohen/status/1812259501665648873). He has [recently caused a noticeable division](https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1dbcd8x/a_schism_is_brewing_in_rsuperstonk_after_gamestop/) within the community through dilution of the stock, being accused of stopping the ape's chance of 'generational wealth'. While there is ongoing comment wars, the moderators have invoked the \"zero politics\" rule and have been deleting a lot of comments, so this is a sample of what's leftover. Other schisms of the ape movement have far more politics present, such as when [Vivek Ramaswamy appeared at a event focused on the \"possible merger\" between Bed-Bath-Beyond and GameStop event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTchjMunrbc), but that's a schism story for another time. **Drama time!** [**\"RYAN COHEN on X\" (LOCKED, 60% upvote ratio with +5,251)**](https://np.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1e2n9cr/ryan_cohen_on_x/) Some apes are sad that Papa/Daddy cohen decided to tweet politics [\"**RYAN COHEN IS OUR DAD**\"](https://np.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1e2n9cr/ryan_cohen_on_x/ld2527u) &gt; Why daddy, why?

My Counter to the above: game stop has the rewards program and game coin, they historically have always used exchange of value of games in trades like an exchange. So I would think they should be more than fine, it‚Äôs always been in their business model and GameStop previously paid a dividend so it‚Äôs not new grounds for them to enter into.

That, plus I want my thoughts recorded for my own posterity. For some time now, I‚Äôve been considering purchasing a Tesla Model 3. I‚Äôm generally a more frugal car enthusiast, and spending $39.9k on any other car would be nuts to me, but the Tesla at least on paper offers a lot to like: there‚Äôs of course the instant acceleration at any speed, but there‚Äôs also the super low CoG, lack of distractions in the cabin (so you can focus on driving!), no warm-up and cool-down procedures, OTA updates that occasionally bring performance and range increases, and no guilt associated with lots of unnecessary driving, which I personally do value. I was also very tempted by Autopilot, since there are times I just don‚Äôt care to drive and would be perfectly happy to let the car do the work. So, to assuage my curiosity, I rented a long-range RWD model for two days from Turo. I spent a couple minutes adjusting settings, drove off, and‚Ä¶ instantly hated it. Right off the bat: * I could not for the life of me get the seat into a comfortable position. The seat bottom was bolstered too much and cut into my thigh, the pressure on my back was awful no matter where I put the lumbar support, and the headrest intrudes forwards and *doesn‚Äôt adjust at all* so when sitting upright, your head actually touches the seat before your shoulders do. Try to put your shoulders against the seat too, and you end up sitting like a hunchback. I absolutely *hated* this, and despite frequently adjusting the seat throughout the two days, I couldn‚Äôt make it any better. * The driver‚Äôs mirror doesn‚Äôt adjust far enough out. I like to follow the recommended method for [eliminating blind spots]( https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a15131074/how-to-adjust-your-mirrors-to-avoid-blind-spots/) but couldn‚Äôt move the mirror far enough to do so. * The turn signal is BMW-style in that it doesn‚Äôt stay where you put it, but rather springs up after you press it so it‚Äôs impossible to tell what it‚Äôs doing by feel alone. Even BMW is reverting on this because it‚Äôs so awful. That said, I did eventually get used to it. * The car was dog slow. Punch it, and it accelerated at a Civic pace. I‚Äôve driven Teslas before, so I knew that wasn‚Äôt right. I eventually found out the car was in Chill Mode, and I fixed it. BUT, my time spent driving it in Chill Mode made me realize just how much of the enjoyment of this car is dependent on acceleration. Take away the acceleration, and you may as well be driving a slightly quieter Civic. But after getting to drive the car some more, I found there were definitely a number of things I liked: * Acceleration at most speeds was solid. While this was no P100D, it definitely has good low-end torque, and of course acceleration is uninterrupted by gear changes. I found it started to run out of steam after 60 or so, and there wasn‚Äôt much of anything left after 80. Still, great for darting around traffic. * The traction control is the best I‚Äôve ever encountered. While I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs possible to turn it off, I don‚Äôt really care: while you can feel it working, it‚Äôs very unobtrusive, and its purpose is more to help put the power down in low-traction situations than to limit power. A huge change from the TC in my Mazdaspeed3, which just cuts engine power at the first sign of wheelspin. * I like the interior overall. The lack of buttons encourages you to focus more on driving (though it does forego something I‚Äôll discuss towards the end), and the touch screen is very responsive with a mostly-intuitive layout. Materials were nice, but nothing special. The dash is soft touch, though it actually looks like hard plastic. The piano-black plastic trim in the center was unsurprisingly already "}

Therefore, I made the decision to compile a variety of things in which the United States excels, and I am confident that there are many more. I'm not american, this post is a response to those absolutely ridiculous takes you see on the Internet. 1 - Economy: The United States has the largest, most technologically powerful and innovative economy in the world. The U.S. dollar is the currency most used in international transactions and is the world's foremost reserve currency, backed by its economy, stable government, and military. New York City is the world's principal financial center. 2 - The US has the most powerful military in the world. 3 - The United States has a larger immigrant population than any other country in the world. Every year, millions of people come to the US in search of freedom and economic opportunities. At this very moment, hundreds of thousands of individuals are making their way through dangerous and unsafe areas just to reach the US. Throughout history, no other country has been as welcoming to migrants as the United States. 4 - The United States is the highest Nobel prize winning country, with a total of 383 winners. 4 - Sports: The US has hosted eight Olympics Games, more than any other country, and the nation's athletes have won the most medals, which total 2,520.

Title should rather be: **Avoiding model 3 depreciation thanks to Qu√©bec EV rebates ending. What do you think?** I'm about to buy a brand new 2024 model 3 (red ext., long range) because I'm hoping that its selling value in the short/medium term would stay relatively constant. I live in Qu√©bec, where we have access to a 12000$ rebate on a new electric vehicle and a 3500$ rebate on used EVs. As of April 1st 2025, 8000$ of that rebate is going to go away, leaving only a 4000$ rebate on brand-new EVs. Looking at the price that a 2024 model 3 sells for in Qu√©bec, there seems to be absolutely no difference with the original purchase price of my configuration (63 000$ net). Considering the price increase for someone looking to get a model 3 and the current low used offers, I'm thus hoping to sell the car in April 2025 and try to make a few grands off of it, or at least break even. Do you think that's realistic? I know that usually cars depreciate as soon as you walk out of the dealership, but I've also heard plenty of stories of people who were able to get a newer Tesla because they were offered more money than they paid for when initially buying it. Model 3 price changes are also to be taken into account here. As Robotaxi Day is coming on Oct. 10th with a potentially new affordable Tesla model at the beginning of next year, I would assume that model 3 prices would go up since it will no longer be the cheapest Tesla you can buy, which means Tesla would probably have to make a bigger price gap between their new affordable model and the model 3. Very curious to get thoughts on this. Edit: I **want** a model 3 anyway, and I really like the 2024 refresh. However, I don't see how paying 2x the price of a used one justifies the new features, hence why I'm trying to know if I will **at least break even** in the short to medium term. I **do not** see this as a real investment, as I'm only trying to avoid depreciation on the car."}

Volvo had itself been acquired in 2010 by Geely, a China-based auto brand that sells vehicles under the brands Geely Auto, Lotus, Lynk &amp; Co, Proton, and Volvo.

The CCP can theoretically shut them down at any moment without warning (see: $DIDI). 2. The stocks are actually ADRs and based in the Cayman Islands, so you don't even own the actual companies. * By comparison, GGPI is headquartered in Sweden and already US-listed on the Nasdaq. * Polestar is already an established OEM, leveraging the strategic relationship with Volvo in manufacturing, design and marketing. Hence, the investment opportunity is lower risk since Polestar is not a start-up. * As with most present-day multinationals, there is some China-related production risk. However, Polestar is addressing the issue by opening US factories going forward. https://preview.redd.it/n5mgt00e7d181.png?width=588&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7487924a42825ba052899aa03fc4fae3d1abe9ec **Gores' Deals** Gores‚Äô track record speaks for itself‚Ä¶ https://preview.redd.it/t1uq0jcg7d181.jpg?width=1972&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6571264d9347fd8f8c237881e1d511b8cca7fae **The EV Graveyard** The EV battlefield is littered with bodies.

The company? **You guessed it, Gamestop. $GME** Everyone thought Tesla was/is an auto OEM. In reality, they're turning into a technology company that also sells cars. Gamestop is being pinned as a brick &amp; mortar retailer. In the future, Gamestop will be a technology first company, that also has a brick &amp; mortar business. I personally feel a ton of massive overperformers that wow people have been at the intersection of traditional industries/sectors, and technology. The ones people argue if they're a XX company or a technology company. Also, I'd like to say, I'm not an \"Ape\" nor is my investment thesis centered around a theoretical MOASS. To be clear, I'm not saying that won't happen. I'm saying I don't know enough about these naked shorting theories, nor do I have the proper access to information. One thing I will say, is I've seen a ton of fishy activity around the stock. But regardless, that doesn't change my perspective on owning the stock. I personally believe this entire story has been incredibly misunderstood by most investors, and clouded by a lot of nonsense on (degensub). Although, there are incredibly smart individuals sharing high-quality research on there for free, its inspiring. I encourage you to give this a read, it might give you a new perspective, if not you can just laugh at me. Lets go üëá (to the moon?) Lets start with a brief history of GameStop and how it managed to be sub $4/share during the COVID-19 market selloff. GameStop started operations in 1984, as Babbage's, a software retailer. They slowly shifted to selling more and more videogame related products before taking on the name of GameStop in 1999. Given the gaming boom that was undergoing, they showed incredible success. They went on to purchase/start various different electronic retailers and build on their GameStop brand, including MovieStop, Eb Games, Rhino video Games, Atrix etc. [https://www.gamestop.com/collection/atrix](https://www.gamestop.com/collection/atrix) They essentially were consolidating the video game retailer market, while exploring different complimentary segments, all typical moves to continue growth for a maturing industry-leader. They missed the entire point though. For GameStop to succeed, it couldn't just be a retailer. They had to become a technology company. GameStop went on to perform quite well, and turned into a dividend stock from the years 2012-2019. 2019 is when the most recent CEO, George Sherman entered the picture. George was suppose to be the savior of GameStop and lead the turn around. The majority of what George Sherman did was buyback shares, and yell omni-channel retailer pivot while slowly generating some of GameStop's revenue online - a true misuse of the world omni-channel, which has become quite the buzzword for nearly every retailer. All while digital downloads of video games were accelerating, threatening their core business model. Plus, e-commerce titans like Amazon were swallowing market share. **August 2020: Ryan Cohen enters the chat** Everyone loves to talk about (degensub) triggering the short squeeze. They might've added fuel to the fire, but this man deserves all the credit. And I do mean credit, not blame. [@ryancohen](https://twitter.com/ryancohen) Ryan is, in my eyes, an inspiration. For those of you who don't know who Ryan Cohen is, he is the founder and former CEO of Chewy .com. He sold it to PetSmart for $3.3B back in 2017. He is often referred to as \"Wall Street's Darling\".

I‚Äôm not very smart and I hate wearing suits. I‚Äôm a boring index-fund guy. After all, history and math show us that the safe path to retirement is to simply plop money into a Vanguard fund every month. And that‚Äôs what I do with most of my money. But sometimes I see a juicy opportunity that fires me up. Occasionally, the timing of that opportunity is juuuuusst right and I put real money on the line. This is one of those situations and I'd love to hear what you think about it. I recently bought 4000 shares of Rivian stock (RIVN). My average cost is just over $16/share. That amounts to about $65,000. At the time of this writing, Rivian floats around $15.00/share and has a $14.5b market cap. I might buy another 1000 shares depending on the feedback that I get to this post. Anyway, here is why I believe Rivian will 3-4x in the next few years. # Point #1 ‚Äì Big Picture - EV‚Äôs Will Win‚Ä¶ Guaranteed. Over the next 25 years, the auto industry is going to transition to electric vehicles because they will be cheaper to buy and operate. Hear me out: 1. Right now, batteries are the most expensive part of an EV. But EV battery tech is in its infancy. Incremental advances in batteries will increase the energy density and versatility of batteries year by year. More importantly, the industry will scale battery production by a few orders of magnitude. This will make EV batteries significantly cheaper to purchase on a per unit basis. 2. Government‚Äôs will continue to incentivize EV purchases with tax credits and other incentives for decades to come. In the long run, governments are definitely going to incentivize large scale energy creation by renewable means (which is getting cheaper and cheaper). On the other hand, western Governments are not going to subsidize or incentivize more coal power plants. That is just a fact. 3. Moreover, gas cars are only going to get more expensive operate because gas is a finite resource. The world is literally running out of oil. We‚Äôve only got like 100-200 years left. So, gas prices are going to go up guaranteed. On the other hand, we ain‚Äôt gonna run out of electricity. Humans will continue to innovate and drive down the relative cost of electricity. This is inevitable. I know I‚Äôm painting with broad strokes here, but I think any rational mind will agree with most of these assertions. Stay with me. This post gets better as I go‚Ä¶ Now, just because EV‚Äôs will be less expensive than ICE vehicles in the long run doesn‚Äôt mean Rivian is going to win the game. OEM‚Äôs like Ford, GM &amp; Stellantis are starting to produce and sell EV‚Äôs‚Ä¶ right??? Won‚Äôt Ford and Toyota and others crush Rivian at the EV game? Nope‚Ä¶ not a chance. Keep reading and I‚Äôll show you why. # Point #2 ‚Äì Pure EV Makers like Rivian &amp; Telsa Will Crush Traditional Auto Manufacturers Ford, GM, and Stellantis don‚Äôt stand a chance against Tesla &amp; Rivian. Even if they start making compelling EV‚Äôs for customers, OEM‚Äôs will be at a long-term structural disadvantage to Rivian &amp; Tesla. Here is why: 1. Rivian does not have a dealership sales model. Dealerships are a useless 3rd party which customers hate. Removing the dealership permits Rivian to sell its vehicles for cheaper than it otherwise could, but also make more profit than it otherwise could. This will be a long-term structural competitive advantage over OEMs. 2. Rivian does not have unions. Unions uniquely harm the automobile industry because the cost of strikes and the cost of artificial wage increases after the strike ends increase the cost of vehicles. The 2023 UAW strike is a good example. If Rivian treats its employees with dignity and respect, they should avoid unionization. This will be a long-term competitive advantage over OEMs. 3. Rivian will make money from servicing and repairing vehicles. In the current OEM-dealership model, the dealership makes more money from the service department th"}

Also apologies if this posted multiple times, Reddit was glitching out. # Story: Picked up a Brand new Model 3 LR w/ Boost on December 12th 2021. Loved the hell out of it! On March 5th, 2022, my Fiancee had a very unfortunate mishap that caused the car to veer off the road and mount a guardrail for about 3 seconds. The damage looked VERY minimal, and the photos make it look as though almost nothing is wrong. Both right-side tires fell off the wheels, and there was some bumper/undercarriage damage. My insurer quoted me at a mere 900$ for the repairs. [Site of the Accident](https://preview.redd.it/zel2859wp7691.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fca85f8f3df800da9d9c8af05962a0f3543e79b7) My main concern was if there was any damage to the battery. I called AAA and got a tow, but this is lesson #1: **KNOW THE NEAREST REPAIR CENTER CLOSEST TO YOU IN ADVANCE.** Tesla doesnt do serious repairs on their own, and I had NO idea where to take the car, so I ended up having it towed to my house for 2 days until I found a shop that could take it. I live in Maine, so it ended up being a place in MA \\~170 miles from me. https://preview.redd.it/5d7wz4pyp7691.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78fea7f7944d1ba3717348f8c997361637026772 https://preview.redd.it/uwtgw6pyp7691.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=779ed81737eb350aad3d4c547286140af53247e0 &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; **Long Story Short:** The guardrail sliced the battery like a sword and caused damage. Since the body of the car is in perfect condition, its salvage value was very high and my insurer (Geico) and the shop decided it was easiest to Total it rather than wait 6+ months for a Battery from Tesla. I paid 52k brand new for it, plus 2K for the boost, and after several price increases during my ownership and tax rebates, Geico settled for 69K!! So all-in I was net-positive by about 12k during my 3 months of ownership, which is crazy. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Immediately turned that 12K into a downpayment on a brand spankin' new MS Plaid, which I took delivery of on June 7th. Original Order Estimate was '4 weeks' when I placed it on March 12th. https://preview.redd.it/61tkdc02q7691.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a65176bc27b371f8ee5bbf6777e571e9f616a114 Words cannot describe how amazing the Plaid is.

Know the closest garage that will service your Tesla, and save it for emergencies. KNOW WHERE TO TOW! 2. Have your contact info attached to a spare keycard, the guys at the garage loved that. 3. The Tow Hook is Lefty-Tighty Righty-Loosey for some reason 4. I was quoted at only 8k to replace the battery of the Model 3. This is a huge deal for long-term ownership.

On Tuesday, shares more than doubled in value, pushing VinFast's market cap to $100 billion at one point in the trading session. Even after giving up some of its substantial intraday gains, it still [easily surpasses](https://companiesmarketcap.com/automakers/largest-automakers-by-market-cap/) highly profitable luxury brands like Mercedes-Benz and BMW, as well as Warren Buffett‚Äìbacked Chinese EV company [BYD](https://fortune.com/company/byd-2/), when it comes to valuations.

It got so bad that in mid-June, VinFast launched a new ‚Äú[special aftersales policy](https://vinfastauto.us/newsroom/press-release/vinfast-announces-global-launch-of-the-special-aftersales-policy)‚Äù entitling owners to sometimes hundreds of dollars in cash for each problem they encountered. ## Ownership questions It typically takes at least a decade and often a generation to build up automotive expertise.

I wouldn't say I felt embarrassed driving it, but it just wasn't something I took pride in when I was driving down the road. So throughout college, I told myself that I would save as much as I could. When I graduated and found a career job, I would spend whatever I was able to save on a new, COOLER, car. I worked every summer, odds and ends of jobs; one year as a camp counselor, one year a marketing intern. I vicously saved all of my summer money that I could throughout the school year. I was fortunate to have parents that covered my basic amenities in college (cheap rented house shared with 4 people, a basic meal plan at the school, stuff like that), so I didn't have to worry about large monthly expenses. I even avoided \"necessity\" purchases like a mattress, instead opting to sleep on a $30 inflatable one. All in the name of saving for a cool car. I graduate college and find a good job at the end of 2012. By this time, I had saved up about $8,000 in my \"car fund\". About 4 months after moving to my current town for work, I come into contact with a higher-up at Microsoft selling his 2005 Audi A6 because he is buying a Tesla. It was top of the line, fully-loaded. 4.2 liter V8, 335hp - the thing was crazy. He was the only owner, bought it new in '05, had all the service records, and was only selling it to clear out the room in his garage. 92,000 miles. He found a dealer that was giving him $12,000 for it. I asked him if I was able to match that offer, would he instead sell to me. He agreed. I proceeded to ask my dad if I could borrow $4,000 from him to cover the difference I needed. Now having a salaried position, I knew I could make car payments relatively easy, I just knew trying to finance this 7 year-old car through a bank as a first-time borrower would be more difficult. He loaned me the money. I was stoked! I had the coolest (and fastest) car of all of my friends. Even though it was 7 years old, it looked new. It had been super well maintained, this guy had just finished performing \"tune-up\" maintenance to sell it, so it had new brakes, new tires, oil was changed, cabin filter, etc etc. Part II - Enlightenment Fast forward about 4 months. Still loving the car. I'm noticing it's kind of expensive to fill up, though, with gas prices being where they were at, and the fact that this thing isn't that fuel efficient (20 - 24 mpg). I'm spending almost $80 to fill the tank up sometimes, but whatever. At this point it's about time for this Audi's first oil change. Wow, $150 for an oil change. Oh, it takes 8 or 9 quarts of oil? And HAS to have the oil that's $10/quart? Yikes. The price I pay for a sweet car I guess! Let's jump ahead another 4 or 5 months. I notice a very deflated tire coming back to my Audi in the parking lot of a restaurant. I baby my way to a local tire shop. Don't exactly remember why the tire couldn't be fixed, but I remember that I had to buy new tires. It's a quattro, so I can't just replace two of them, it needs all four replaced. Oh this Audi takes super wide, weird-sized tires? Ok, how much are those? $900? Holy &amp;%*#. Ok, well get it done I guess. Now the fun starts. Myself and my (now) fianc√© are driving back from a weekend getaway. I notice the car doesn't seem to have the umph it should hav"}

There have been several posts over the past few months on this forum where folks are considering a new 911 or upgrade their existing one. It has inspired me to share my story. It is a long one but trust me it has a happy ending! Last year, I was in a similar situation and looking for an upgrade. I had a 991.1 C4S that I bought new in 2015. I never thought about reselling it and drove it everywhere. The car was the opposite of ‚Äúgarage queen‚Äù. As it happens with all toys, I started craving a potential upgrade around late 2021, early 2022. Honestly, I was so happy with my 911, I wasn‚Äôt even thinking about other options. I just wanted a better 911. My requirements hadn‚Äôt changed since I last bought the car, I don‚Äôt track it, I have a young kid (so 2+2 was a must), my wife occasionally drove the car (so no stick) and I‚Äôm personally not into over the top design e.g. the wing. So, long story short, a 718 or GT3/RS were never on my shortlist. My list started and ended with a 992 Turbo S. Early in 2022, I went to the multiple dealers near me and asked about allocations for a new Turbo S and I was told there is a waiting list for about 8-10 months. It was right after Covid, manufacturing is impacted so I said ‚Äúfair enough‚Äù and put finally my name around with a dealer around early-mid 2022 for a Turbo S allocation. Mind you, I am an existing owner, so I didn‚Äôt think too much about being treated as someone who wasn‚Äôt serious. The spec I configured was a decent one with almost $30k in options for a total of ~$260k MSRP. No other conversation was had, no other kind of payment was brought up. Dealer even told me that I‚Äôd be getting some fancy watch to go with my new car! Few months go by, crickets. Towards the end of the 2022, I emailed the dealer asking for an update. She said ‚Äúnothing yet, we‚Äôre still behind blah blah‚Äù. I said ok, will keep waiting - not like I‚Äôm stuck driving M3 or *shudder* a Tesla ;). Beginning of 2023 was busy for me with work travel so I kind of forgot about the car. I reached out to the dealer in April. This time I was a bit upset. It had been months and there was nothing from them, no communication, no acknowledgment, nothing. This is when she brings up ‚Äúmarket adjustment‚Äù of $25k. I was pissed. I wasn‚Äôt going to get in front of another queue for at least another few months. I wasn‚Äôt even in the market for the ‚Äúhot‚Äù GT3/RS that almost everyone else was (and still is) buying to flip. I wanted a genuine upgrade to my daily driver that I would have happily kept and driven for the next decade. I was so happy with my 911 that I wasn‚Äôt even thinking about anything else. [Soapbox] To the ‚ÄúGt3-is-my-daily-driver‚Äù crowd, please be honest with yourself. DM me in a year when your back and ass are constantly hurting daily driving a car with suspension made out of rock. To the genuinely small number of people who plan to keep the car for track days and use the car for what‚Äôs it good for, you have my respect.[/Soapbox] This is when things changed for me. I started thinking logically. Simple math, if I am paying almost $300k with taxes and registration, I now have other options on the table. This is also when I started to really focus on what I wanted from a car and came to the, now obvious, conclusion that what I really I wanted was a sporty grand tourer that was at least a 2+2 and automatic (to drive the kid around for a few more years and keep the wife happy). With my newfound freedom of choice, I started to look at other options, outside of 911s. There were three legitimate contenders and a secret one - 1. a Continental GT (easier to get, comfortable like no other car I‚Äôve ever been in but a bit too Septuagenarian looks for my taste), 2. a DB11 (very easy to get, lot more sportier, much better looking but outdated interior that felt too cramped for a 2+2), 3. a Roma (drop dead gorgeous, extremely sporty drive and relatively comfortable with air suspension optioned but pain in"}

Let's talk Hyliion. *Note: This is an interactive post. That means you're expected to click the links before you leave a dumbass comment.* # HYLIION (HYLN): The fuck??? Hyliion is a company that develops and sells electric powertrain systems for transport trucks involved in long-distance trucking. Their drivetrain -- the Hypertruck ERX -- is fueled by compressed natural gas (CNG) and/or renewable natural gas (RNG), which are MUCH more green than diesel, which is used by most trucking companies. RNG can even achieve **negative emissions**. You know when you turn loose an earth-shaking fart in a very public setting, and you just wish you could suck that noxious gas back up inside you to avoid further humiliation from that flower-wilting smell? Well, this is almost identical to that. Kind of. I know what you're thinking: *\"So what? This dinosaur can un-fart gas. Aren't we moving away from gas and towards fully electric, hydrogen-powered, and nuclear fusion-powered vehicles anyway?\"* There's a few things to keep in mind: * Stuff needs to get shipped TODAY * There **aren't** enough plug-in refueling stations for **transport trucks** in the US * There **aren't** enough hydrogen refueling stations in the US (only 39 currently) * There **are** currently enough CNG and RNG refueling stations for the trucking industry * CNG/RNG is currently 1/12 the price of hydrogen and 1/7 the price of electric refueling * In the future, CNG/RNG will be 1/3 the price of hydrogen, and 1/2 the price of electric refueling * HYLN's powertrain is designed specifically to be able to be used with hydrogen in the future, anyway * Trucking companies aren't going to want to wait around [30 minutes](https://www.businessinsider.com/this-expert-says-tesla-semi-is-economically-and-ecologically-pointless-2019-2) for their trucks to get an 80% charge every [500 miles](https://www.autoweek.com/news/green-cars/a34774933/musk-now-says-621-miles-of-range-for-tesla-semi/) (source: latest max range \\* 80%) using a theoretical megacharger station which [doesn't even exist](https://www.torquenews.com/11663/tesla-looking-develop-so-called-megachargers-tesla-semi-trucks) currently, and also lose 1 ton in carrying capacity due to the weight of the battery Source: [https://i.ibb.co/WpQy5NL/hylnfuel.png](https://i.ibb.co/WpQy5NL/hylnfuel.png) HYLN's powertrain also offers other advantages: * Increases efficiency and reduces cost of gas for truckers by up to 35% (one of the biggest costs for trucking companies) * Drastically increases pulling power up hills (time is money, dongus) * Software uses machine learning that optimizes driving patterns, introducing further savings * Eliminates need for idling vehicle when truckers are staying overnight in the cabin with a couple of \"friends of the road\" I can hear you now: \"*But "}
{"brand": "Tesla", "archetype": "Rebel", "source": "reddit", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModelY/comments/1epldcl/yet_another_tesla_trade_in_nightmare/", "text": "Yet another Tesla trade in nightmare **EDIT 08-13-2024 14:57 EST** Tesla rep called me earlier today to discuss my questions including the trade issue. Joshua was friendly, articulate and seemed to know what was up. He couldnt't figure out what happened with the trade, so he suggested I re-enter the trade info and he'd watch it on his end. I do as requested and the trade value is now higher than the original offer and the app requested more info including a pic of the odometer and title front and back. Offer was given and now it says the trade offer is good until September 12. Financing options all updated to reflect the new trade offer so I accepted all that and we seem to be good to go. Car is supposed to hit the delivery location on 08-19-2024. Let's see what happens now. **EDIT 08-11-2024 06:00 PM EST** Tesla replied (via the app) to my question about why the trade value dropped 60% and said they don't see a trade associated with this purchase and would I like to continue with the purchase, lol. They don't even see the trade they lowballed me on. Wow. :P I'm posting this for anyone searching to learn more about the Tesla trade process. My experience is just a data point for you to consider and added to the other trade in stories. I'm dealing with the Mt. Kisco Tesla delivery center (I think...all comms are with faceless texts so far and one phone rep who couldn't find the car I wanted that was listed right in Tesla inventory while we were on the phone) Tesla offers me $19K for a 21 Prius Prime Limited. Yes, well under wholesale based on other offers from dealers and online buyers, but with the tax break when trading in NY it's close enough. I wouldn't have to rent a car to go pick up the MYP so that saves me some money and time. We get closer to the delivery date and I get a message that Tesla has updated my offer information. Open the app and they've lowered the trade offer to $11,400. wtf? That's about half of average wholesale. They didn't request any photos of the car (which is pristine, non smoker, new tires) so it's confusing what caused this. These cars are very popular and incredibly reliable so... If Tesla doesn't want my trade, just tell me up front. It would have saved me nearly 10 days of planning how I'll pick up the new car. Now, I'm scrambling to figure out what I'll do with the trade. If I bail on the deal I lose $250, plus the $250 for the charger they've already shipped me (since they don't include an EVSE with a $60K car). So far, dealing with Tesla has been the weirdest and least upfront car purchase I've experienced and I've bought almost 50 cars in my lifetime (new and used). The lack of communication, getting ghosted once the order was placed and having the trade price dropped by 60% really hasn't created any good feelings towards the brand. I know others have had a different experience, but that doesn't negate mine. Good luck to you if you're shopping."}

But as I was driving, something caught my eye... Make no mistake. This stock is not going to be nearly as volatile or profitable as GME. In fact, this might be so boring that most of you will ignore me yet again. **And that‚Äôs exactly why I like it.** I‚Äôll do my best to make this engaging, but the fact is, this is going to be a slow grind. Both this DD and the stock. Also, as a bonus, Reddit is currently public enemy #1 in the eyes of the media. Why don‚Äôt we do a quick heel-turn and join their side? Are they gonna hate us for buying boring value stocks? They won‚Äôt know what hit them. That will be a fun show to watch. Anyway‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs take a look under the hood. **As always, not financial advice. Just education. NOTHING IS A RECOMMENDATION. We are just sharing knowledge here. Ok SEC?** **Intro:** Ford (NYSE: $F -- NOT NASDAQ:$FORD), is another depressed deep value multiple expansion arbitrage play. No short squeeze this time. The GME asymmetry may not be seen again for 10 years. It might seem boring and unsexy on the surface, but Ford is a fantastic company in the midst of one of the best turnarounds in American history. And with a little help from our friend Mr. Options (or as Buffett called, Financial Weapons of Mass Destruction) we can turn a boring old Ford into a lightning fast Ferrari using the quadruple income option wheel strategy. Don‚Äôt try this at home. If you don‚Äôt know what CSPs, CCs, or vega are, stick to shares. Those should work just fine. Let‚Äôs break this down into 5 parts: electrification story and leadership, multiples expansion, technical analysis, options, and the trade. By the way, in 2019, the Ford F-Series was second only to the Apple iPhone, which raked in $55 billion, in terms of total revenue generated. The F-Series generated more revenue than the NFL, MLB, NBA, and the NHL combined, which added up to $40 billion. Just something to think about. &gt; The wheels on the bus go round and round, round and round... **Electrification story and leadership:** Let‚Äôs jump into history for a second. Ford had a meteoric rise from 1997 - 1999 from $15 to around $32 at the peak. This was due to $F reporting massive earnings increases each quarter: * [Dec 1996 - 1997 Ford F-150 - Truck of the Year](https://www.motortrend.com/news/1997-ford-f150-truck-of-the-year/) * [Jan 1997 - Ford profits up 82 percent](https://money.cnn.com/1997/01/29/companies/ford/) * [Oct 1997 - Ford profits up 64 percent](https://www.spokesman.com/stories/1997/oct/16/ford-earnings-surge-64/) * [Jan 1998 - Ford profits up 56 percent](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1998-jan-28-fi-12792-story.html) They were just feasting and feasting. Jim Farley looks like the best person alive to revitalize Ford, capable of tripling the stock in 2-3 years. Look at the last two quarters: * Q3-2020 - Adjusted EPS: 65 cents vs 19 cents expected, Automotive revenue: $34.71 billion vs $33.51 billion expected (due to pent up demand) * Q2-2020 - Adjusted EPS: A loss of 35 cents per share versus a loss of $1.17 per share expected, Automotive revenue: $16.6 billion versus $15.95 billion expected. Here are excerpts from the Q3 earnings and some other notable highlights: &gt; Farley: Now that plan, which was introduced to the Ford team and many stakeholders on October 1, is very straightforward. Among other things, No. 1, we will compete like a challenger, earning each customer with great products but as well services with rewarding ownership experiences. Number two, we're moving with urgency to turn around our automotive operations, improve our quality, reduce our cost and acceler"}

Before I jump into the stock related stuff, as an old, I feel it is important to preface this with a little cautionary advice. Here is my three points of \"don't be stupid\": 1. I know Richmond has a storied history of burning shit going all the way back to the Civil War- but don't burn any Teslas. It's not worth it. And it's stupid. Furthermore, you are putting first responders at risk. You will also likely get caught. At least here in Virginia, there are [cameras everywhere](https://cardinalnews.org/2025/03/28/i-drove-300-miles-in-rural-virginia-then-asked-police-to-send-me-their-public-surveillance-footage-of-my-car-heres-what-i-learned/) and Tesla's themselves will record you. It's just not worth throwing your life away no matter how mad you might be. Before you get labeled a domestic terrorist and thrown in an El Salvadorian prison, read some Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and get some perspective. He wrote from a Russian gulag after sharing his negative opinion of Stalin. We are currently on Reddit and nobody is going to jail for it. 2. Don't harass individual Tesla owners. They didn't do anything to deserve it and most likely hate what is happening as well. I know some of them. It is unreasonable to ask them to dump their daily driver at a huge loss because Elon decided to make himself into a human lighting rod. 3. I deliberately waited for the \"Tesla Takedown\" to be over before making this post so nobody would get any bright ideas. What you think is making a difference is likely to have the opposite effect from what you are hoping for. The people trying to stick it to Trump just got him more [support from billionaires](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckvvlv3lewxo) after he was convicted and if you didn't notice, $TSLA started deep in the red yesterday after the Tesla Takedown over the weekend and rallied way back and finished considerably up today. None of that moved the needle in any direction but up. Furthermore, if you burn or vandalize a Tesla, the insurance company will pay for it and just jack up all of our rates in turn. If any destroyed cars are still owned by Tesla, they will just use accounting methods to write it off. And that is one less car they don't have to sell at a time when they aren't selling many, which is the ultimate point of this post and makes a nice segue. If you are mad about what Elon Musk is doing, or just want to make money on your $TSLA puts (like me- position disclosed), what sends a stronger message? A few burnt up Teslas or entire parking lots full of them because nobody wants to buy them? In my opinion, as well as [others with puts](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/nick-denton-interview-thiel-musk) on Tesla and think Elon has lost it, it is the latter. Speaking of which... I found one such parking lot! First, check out the few pictures I took of the local Tesla dealership here in Richmond (just outside the city). Their lot is clearly over capacity but nothing jaw dropping. There are a few dozen vehicles on the street and in a neighboring parking lot. After I shared these with a few friends, one of them told me that there were vehicle transporters unloading new Teslas near his work, which is a few miles away from the dealership and in an area of office buildings that have nothing to do with Tesla. I checked it out and there are a lot of them stuffed in the back of the lot. It's hard to see because I took the pictures at night and the cars are spread out but there are easily over 20 Cybertrucks and probably somewhere near 50 vehicles in total.

I'm keeping my S4 and 718 Cayman S as well, so this was going to be in addition to those 2. I've been in enough Audi/BMW/Mercs/Porsches and wanted something different. Smooth power, roomy interior, cool factor and quiet ride were my main considerations. I don't need the all out performance of something like an X3M or GLC63 since I've got other cars. I wanted this to be a stark contrast to my current 2 vehicles. &amp;nbsp; Decided a MYP would be a good fit, especially with very strong resale value. I can keep it for a few years and see what the electric market is like with Rivian, electric Macan etc. The ordering and delivery process was terrible, but that's another story. It was easily the worst \"dealership\" experience I've had buying any car (new or used). &amp;nbsp; Anyways, I get my car on the evening of Dec 10th. By the afternoon of the 11th, it had a rear motor failure followed by a completely dead vehicle that's unable to drive. &amp;nbsp; **Motor Failure** Picked up my blue on white MYP on the evening of Dec 10th. By the afternoon of the 11th, it had a [rear motor failure](https://imgur.com/FqTE42h) and 2 mins later was [completely undriveable](https://imgur.com/2NQjz3W) and had to be towed to the dealer. It was being driven at 60km/h when a warning came up about the rear motor. A couple mins later, it was fully dead. Luckily I was near a friends house and parked it in their driveway. Would have sucked if this happened on the highway. I googled the error and it seems like this has happened to other people before, and usually pretty soon after delivery. Still, off too a pretty terrible start with the car. &amp;nbsp; Bad things I've noticed over the first 24hrs, coming from someone who's into cars and driven a bunch of stuff on street/track: &amp;nbsp; **Build Quality:** Wasn't expecting much here, so I was ok with some gaps and not having perfect panels. There was some glue residue on the edges of the panoramic roof, and there were marks on the headliner when I took delivery. The interior plastic piece on the b pillar has a massive gap between it and the roof on 1 side. Otherwise, I'm totally ok with it. I knew what I was getting into and wasn't expecting it to be on the level of the germans. &amp;nbsp; **Closing the Door:** You have to pull pretty hard to actually close the door. It wasn't just me either. Multiple people failed to close the door properly the first time they tried. You really have to slam it more than any other car I've owned. Not a very nice experience for the user. I can imagine some older person actually having trouble to close it properly. &amp;nbsp; **Honk Upon Lock:** I can't believe this car makes a cheap honk sound when you lock it like some early 2000s GM car. It should 100% have some pleasant sounding chip/beep. &amp;nbsp; **Loud Seat Motors:** Loudest seat motors I've heard, especially the lumbar. &amp;nbsp; **Cheap Carpet Mats:** I've already installed proper mats, but the stock carpet mats (only included for driver and passenger) are the thinnest and cheapest feeling carpet mats I've experienced. They're so lightweight and flimsy with no impression of quality. This doesn't matter too much, but it speaks to the cost cutting happening everywhere. &amp;nbsp; **Can't View Songs on Phone?** Unless I'm dumb, is there actually no way to view a list of all music on my iPhone and pick something? The interface between phone and the car is terrible and super limited. I really hope I'm missing something here. There isn't even an easy way to activate Siri since the in-car voice button will trigger the Tesla voice assistant. Very disappointed in the user experience here. &amp;nbsp; **Flimsy Sunshades:** Once again, more cost cutting. You can easily feel the cardboard inside them. There is absolutely no feeling of quality when ope"}

Most of the recommended lights won't have all of them, but these are things to look for when shopping for lights: * Neutral white tint - the [vast majority](https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/5yjqcr/poll_preferred_color_temperature/) of people with an opinion prefer a color temperature that's within the range of direct sunlight, which is generally marketed as \"neutral white\", but sometimes as \"warm white\" * A lack of red, or especially green off-tints, beam artifacts and tint shift from the center of the beam to the edges * A user interface that does not require cycling through different modes to turn off, and does not change modes every time the light is turned off * A lack of blinking modes within the standard mode rotation, either because the light doesn't have any, or they're \"hidden\" by being accessed in a different manner than the usual modes * An IP waterproofing rating - most good lights are rated for IPX8 with the depth and duration of submersion specified by the manufacturer * A lack of timed stepdowns. Some lights only produce their maximum output for a few minutes at a time. While some powerful lights can get too hot to hold if run on high constantly, the hardware necessary to measure temperature and only reduce power if the light is actually too hot costs only a few cents, but many lights won't overheat badly anyway * Full-spectrum, or high-CRI for more accurate color rendering. Color rendering index, or CRI is the most common measurement of this; average LEDs are about 70. Over 80 is decent, and over 90 is excellent. The highest I've heard of from an LED is [99](http://budgetlightforum.com/node/60236). This is more important for seeing detail than absolute output and can be the difference between a stick and a snake on the trail. * A sub-lumen moonlight mode (for general-use lights) * A user interface that allows access to the lowest and highest modes from off without having to cycle through other modes * A user interface where a single click turns the light on in a reasonable mode, and another single click turns it off. # About specs Lumens are total output. Don't worry about small differences in output. You probably can't detect a 10% difference in lumens with your eyes, and 20% is barely noticeable. It takes 4 times the lumens to look twice as bright. Candela is intensity, which translates to throw distance. FL1 throw numbers are about right for detecting large objects; cut them in half for seeing clearly. Extreme throw distances also run in to limits imposed by human vision and by backscatter in the atmosphere. Warmer tints have less backscatter. FL1 runtime numbers are to 10% output and can be misleading. Look for a review with a runtime graph. Performance specs for AA and AAA powered lights are usually given with NiMH rechargeable batteries. Alkalines don"}

Nor on what this means for **future** sales, market and company prospects. This is not surprising, many investors are no longer interested in companies and their products at all, only in (minimal) daily profits, especially the short sellers who \"argue\" with \"arguments\" like \"*what* *a* *scam*\", \"*what* *a* *sh.. \"* and the like \"argue\" without ever substantiating this classification. Main thing to create a (negative) mood to get others to sell. Same in the opposite direction. There is daily speculation about takeovers or attempts to bring about a short squeeze based on certain percentages that a stock is sold short. Both are wrong in the first place. Hardly any investors still invest in products and companies, many are only \"gamblers\". At the same time, these players put products, companies and jobs at risk. For example, a good product cannot be developed and sold overnight. Nevertheless, these gamblers expect results in days or weeks and months at the most, and if they don't come immediately, this is made out to be a problem. Even though everything within the company is on schedule. Even the development of an iPhone takes a year or more. More and more often you can read, especially with new products or companies, that the company has not made any sales or profits yet. How could it, if the product is still in development? If that still doesn't work, the killer argument will eventually be used. Competitor XYZ is already on the market and sells more. Or already has many partners. This was also the argument regarding Apple when Nokia was still the world market leader for mobile phones and smartphones and Apple presented the first iPhone. The outcome is well known. Or with Tesla vis-√†-vis the established car manufacturers. Today, a Tesla drives away even a Porsche and Tesla is constantly building new factories. Porsche, on the other hand, is also doing well, but cannot keep up with Tesla's expansion and is technically (e.g. in terms of range) lagging behind. What all of this has in common is that you can't extrapolate from the past to the future. Otherwise, there would never be new market leaders. The future of a company lies in its current and future- oriented products, not in its old ones. There are, of course, exceptions to the rule, such as food manufacturers, like Coca-Cola, or banks, etc. Here, however, it should be about technical products and their manufacturers. **Summary: Ultimately, only the business outlook determines the future of a company and thus the share price. The business outlook depends on the current and future products.** That is why short sales figures etc. are not considered here. Instead,it will be shown **why there is currently only one company in the field of lidar sensors that meets all the requirements of large car manufacturers** such as Volkswagen, Toyota, etc. and where **a short squeeze could be triggered shortly due to their technical superiority**, since this technological superiority cannot be explained away or \"sold short\". **It should likely cause price reactions when a company is valued at only about 1/3 the market cap of inferior competitors on the stock market, as** **Microvision** **currently is relative to** [**Luminar.**](https://www.luminartech.com/) Both companies in September 2021 at the world's largest motor show IAA in Munich: https://preview.redd.it/ohvcmi2v9vs71.png?width=1378&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6df79bd47d043efb1f2fb2810649e65becd691e0 Sources: private Because in the field of lidar for self-driving cars (levels 3-5), the current \"official\" market leader is Luminar. \"Market leade"}

We will answer once and for all what is the fair value of TSLA. &amp;#x200B; **Chapter 1. Bull thesis (and other lies I tell myself?)** &amp;#x200B; Let's start with the typical bull thesis. The one you have probably encountered many times in the wilderness of reddit or twitter. It goes like this: &amp;#x200B; * Tesla's car sales will grow 50% annually for foreseeable future. Eventually reaching annual production rate of 20M by 2030. Source: [Technoking himself](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1310486616075579393) &amp;#x200B; * Net margins will stay as high or even grow further from the latest 13.1% (Q4 2021). Commonly cited reasons are 4680, Gigacasting... maybe even Alien Dreadnought? &amp;#x200B; * Tesla is a tech company. They will generate tons of revenue by selling software such as ~~Fraud~~ Full-Self-Driving, and might eventually launch their own marketplace (see AppStore). &amp;#x200B; * Tesla is... *ETF**?* (cannot add a link to youtube video, but it is from solving the money problem) &amp;#x200B; * Tesla ~~sex~~bot. Enough said. &amp;#x200B; Let's start with an automotive sales part: &amp;#x200B; * Say Tesla is such Gigachad^(TM) that it reaches 20M sales without reducing the prices or introducing the cheaper model(s). According to Q4 2021 Financial Report, current **ASP is $50.7K**, derived as auto revenue excl. regulatory credits divided by the number of delivered cars. Assuming 3% average inflation for the next 9 years (incl. current spike) the ASP in 2030 would be **$66.2K** (50.7 x 1.03\\^9) &amp;#x200B; * With **net margins of 13%** that would result in **66.2K x 20M x 0.13 = $172B net income**. &amp;#x200B; * Eventually growth by 2030 will taper and converge to automotive industry average. As of writing, PEs of auto peers: Toyota - 9.64, Volkswagen - 6.88, Ford - 10.10, GM - 7.10, BMW - 4.75. But Tesla being Tesla, so we award an automotive **Tesla PE of 15**. &amp;#x200B; * Tesla market cap by end 2030 is (drum roll...) **172B x 15 = 2.58T**. An absolute automotive leader with 20M sales at an average price of 66.2K USD, with outstanding operating margins (\\~twice the industry average), with PE 15 (approximately twice the industry average) will triple from the current valuation (or double from January 3's)? &amp;#x200B; * Taking an average of 7% market growth leads to Net Present Value (NPV) of 2.58T / 1.07\\^9 = **1.4T\\*,** so *...* Tesla on January 3rd was pretty fairly valued? Although why would anyone invest in a single stock for a 7% growth versus investing into SPY? &amp;#x200B; * From the other angle, if you invest in TSLA now (market cap of 890B as of writing) it will return you (2.58 / 0.89)\\^(1/9) = 1.125 or **12.5% annually**. Not too shabby, but also anything but impressive in contrast to its growth in the last two years. &amp;#x200B; But careful observer would remind me that we are talking about *Tech* company and not an *Auto* company. But before we go there... let's discuss what is wrong with the bull thesis above. &amp;#x200B; **Chapter 2. Automotive market.** &amp;#x200B; Many analyses that I have read address future volumes only from the perspective of the supply. Analyses argue that the ramp up of the existing factories plus the introduction of new ones can support 50% growth, eventually reaching 20M car sales by 2030. What they often fail to address is the total addressable market (TAM), which is in our case the EV market in 2030. To be clear, below we will include both plug-in hybrids (PHEV) and battery electric vehicles (BEV) as parts of the EV market. The main reasoning is that for a wide target audience PHEV covers 95% of all use-cases (daily trips within a city) with electric power, therefore creates a real alternative to buying BEV (what happened to me and my wife personally). &amp;#x200B; No doubt the EV market will be enormous by 2030.

For many of us whether we made 100k or were left with $10 we were going to take the proceeds to buy a slice of pizza and a beer. So hold.... you don't know what happens next. That is the beauty of speculative investing. The good news is neither do the hedge funds. Here are a few things to keep in mind. Feel free to add or discuss. Maybe someone of meaningful repute will take a fancy. &amp;#x200B; 1. You can only look at this as a loss if you are a paperhand. If you are holding look at this nebulous \"loss\" as an investment in market transparency that could potentially pay dividends for retail investors down the road. You don't know whether or not what has occurred here could potentially tip the scale in your favor at a later date in your investment career. 2. Neither you nor any hedge funds know that these companies are toast. Yes by any traditional metric they could make an argument for it. This WSB experience has fundamentally changed their thesis whether they realize it or not. That is the exact reason you should hold. That and basically because the number one rule of investing is never lose money. 3. Valuing GME or AMC prior to WSB is a valuation of a completely different brand/company. We have created 3 things that are priceless. ORGANIC ENTHUSIASM, RIDICULOUS BRAND LOYALTY, AND UNDENIABLE BUZZ. People build multimillion dollar corporations with the intent of accomplishing this task for others. You can try to buy what we have created for these companies but it just isn't the same (like making a wendys frosty at home). These brands now own something more which could be more valuable than their original business model. Everyone loves a story. It's only a matter of time before a team is compiled to leverage this secret sauce and boot strap the next phase of the business lifecycle. 4. Given the lower valuation and the intrinsic/intangible value of these brands they could absolutely pull off one hell of a pivot or be the target of an acquisition. I'm spitballing ideas and I've seen some thrown around about Tesla buying gamestop. They could perhaps be used to rapidly roll out hundreds of testdrive centers across the country. Or perhaps they are purchased by Rockstar or EA. Maybe even Sony or Nintendo steps in and creates a direct to consumer experience. If not what if it just remained a brick and mortar retailer with a different tint. People act like brick and mortar is dead, but nobody wrote off Five Below stock. FIVE has totally crushed it this year! Who is to say it couldn't inhabit this strange space as a meme store with $5 items inspired by the internet. That is to say unless they don't end up using this buzz to get some heavy hitters on board and build the ultimate gaming/fintech cloud. People waited in line at Gamestop pre pandemic and with this much enthusiasm behind the name they may do it again. They will for damn sure wait in line at the movies again! I think we need to reenvision the theater experience. Imagine people taking self driving vehicles to the theater to drink beer and watch live sporting events while placing bets on their smartphones as the theater partners with Draftkings or Penn National. Who is to say Disney doesn't just say I'll take it. They could convert every theater into a Disney + experience in hundreds of towns across the nation! Disney is the experience brand, they could bring theaters to life in a way that nobody could even imagine. Characters, costumes, decorum, and live events. If I could take my daughters to watch and meet Bluey at our own little piece of Disney World right here in town I would do it in a heartbeat. Literally millions of other parents would also, even if it was the same content we already streamed at home. Bottom line the hedge funds forget the value is in the people not "}
{"brand": "Tesla", "archetype": "Rebel", "source": "reddit", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/vwiy5g/ultimate_guide_to_why_you_should_buy_gamestop_now/", "text": "Ultimate Guide to why you should buy Gamestop now This is not financial advice, do your own research. I have been criticizing myself for not writing this sooner and better, and time is running out for me to do it, so here goes. I don't want to be accused of not trying, to hear \"why didn't you tell me\". Below is my reasoning why in my opinion you should buy Gamestop stock, ticker GME, broken up into the following sections: TL;DR My Story Short Squeeze Thesis Natural Growth Thesis If you have more questions, a good starting point is the top 2 stickied posts in R/Superstonk https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/ As for how to buy, it is pretty easy to open a Fidelity account, connect it to your checking account, and transfer the funds over. You should get on that. Too Long; Didn't Read (TL;DR): First, if this is all new to you, there is a year and a half of information you've missed that I do not have the time to write up and you do not have the time to read because it would take you days. This is my attempt to throw a rope of financial freedom to as many people as possible. I'm telling you that spending $130ish now could make you wealthy enough to completely change the rest of your life and your children's lives. If you don't take the rope, it's on you, I tried. Second, if you think you missed the boat, if you think \"what good is 1 or even 10 shares going to do me\", just know that if the short thesis is true, if Gamestop is still shorted over 140% and possibly over 1000%, then 1 share could be worth millions if you hold onto it. Third, forget what Gamestop was, the little game store in dying malls. Look at what it is now, a tech company led by Chairman of the Board Ryan Cohen and a team of executives who left phenomenal careers with companies like Amazon and Wal-Mart to work there. As just one example of its pivot, Gamestop will be releasing an NFT marketplace soon with the intent of revolutionizing the digital marketplace. Think of Gamestop like Microsoft, Apple, Amazon or Google during their startup phase but instead of starting with nothing they are starting out with thousands of stores and infrastructure and brand recognition and loyal customers. Everyone always says they wish they had bought lots of shares of Microsoft, Apple, or Amazon back when you first could and held them through stock splits. This is your chance to say \"I bought\" instead of \"I wish I'd bought. Gamestop is still insanely shorted (estimates over 1000%), and Gamestop is issuing a 4-1 share dividend as stock split on 7/21/22 which means if you buy a GME share by 7/21 (to be safe try to get one by 7/18) you will have 4 shares after the split, and because this is a dividend as a split and not a simple stock split, this may cause the short squeeze and this may be your last chance to buy before the price becomes unaffordable. So in my opinion you should buy at least 1 share this week. And if $130/share is too expensive for you, then after the split you should buy at least 1 share at the post-split price whatever it is, if you still can. And in my opinion you should buy as much as you can afford. I have over 1200 shares which are about to become over 4800. Just know that if you buy, you need to hold tight and be prepared to see the price drop. I originally bought in at $100/share, and saw the price rise to $483, then down to $38, and then up and down everywhere in-between since. The price will be whatever short sellers want it to be until they cannot short it any longer so buckle up. And if this split does not launch the short squeeze, just know that investors have already Direct Registered over 15 million shares of Gamestop with Gamestop's transfer agent Computershare, and eventually investors will Direct Register every single GME share with Computershare and prove the naked shorting of Gamestop. If 61 million more people just bought 1 share and DRS'ed it with Computershare right away such that all 76 million shares were direct registered, the truth would be evi"}

I will be updating this continuously throughout the day with the conclusion of each publications and any new review links. This will be sorted alphabetically. # Written Articles # Anandtech - TBD # Arstechnica - TBD # [Babeltechreviews](https://babeltechreviews.com/the-rtx-3090-founders-edition-performance-revealed-35-games-spec-workstation-gpgpu-benchmarked/) &gt;NVIDIA says that the RTX 3080 is the gaming card and the RTX 3090 is the hybrid creative card ‚Äì but we respectfully disagree. The RTX 3090 is the flagship gaming card that can also run intensive creative apps very well, especially by virtue of its huge 24GB framebuffer. But it is still not an RTX TITAN nor a Quadro. These cards cost a lot more and are optimized specifically for workstations and also for professional and creative apps. &gt; &gt;However, for RTX 2080 Ti gamers who paid $1199 and who have disposable cash for their hobby ‚Äì although it has been eclipsed by the RTX 3080 ‚Äì the RTX 3090 Founders Edition which costs $1500 is *the* card to maximize their upgrade. And for high-end gamers who also use creative apps, this card may become a very good value. Hobbies are very expensive to maintain, and the expense of PC gaming pales in comparison to what golfers, skiers, audiophiles, and many other hobbyists pay for their entertainment. But for high-end gamers on a budget, the $699 RTX 3080 will provide the most value of the two cards. We cannot call the $1500 RTX 3090 a ‚Äúgood value‚Äù generally for gamers as it is a halo card and it absolutely does not provide anywhere close to double the performance of a $700 RTX 3080. &gt; &gt;However, for some professionals, *two* RTX 3090s may give them exactly what they need as it is the only Ampere gaming card to support NVLink providing up to 112.5 GB/s of total bandwidth between two GPUs which when SLI‚Äôd together will allow them to access a massive 48GB of vRAM. SLI is no longer supported by NVIDIA for gaming, and emphasis will be placed on mGPU only as implemented by game developers. # [Digital Foundry Article](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2020-nvidia-geforce-rtx-3090-review) # [Digital Foundry Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmeWo7BLN9Y) &gt;So there we have it. The RTX 3090 delivers - at best - 15 to 16 per cent more gaming performance than the RTX 3080. In terms of price vs performance, there is only one winner here. And suffice to say, we would expect to see factory overclocked RTX 3080 cards bite into the already fairly slender advantage delivered by Nvidia's new GPU king. Certainly in gaming terms then, the smart money would be spend on an RTX 3080, and if you're on a 1440p high refresh rate monitor and you're looking to maximise price vs performance, I'd urge you to look at the RTX 2080 Ti numbers in this review: if Nvidia's claims pan out, you'll be getting that and potentially more from the cheaper still RTX 3070. All of which raises the question - why make an RTX 3090 at all? &gt; &gt;The answers are numerous. First of all, PC gaming has never adhered to offering performance increases in line with the actual amount of money spent. Whether it's Titans, Intel Extreme processors, high-end motherboards or performance RAM, if you want the best, you'll end up paying a huge amount of money to attain it.

Total cost to transition was just **$41,500** and we're saving $4,500 annually on electric vs. gas. Why doesn't everyone do this!? &amp;#x200B; **Our Experience:** Just wanted to document my experience transitioning entirely to Tesla within the last two months. Mid January, a deer stepped in front of my ICE. Wife and I are the types that tend to keep cars until the maintenance becomes a headache, and we both have been driving 8-9 year old cars that have been paid off for years, with a combined 350k miles between them. I knew the time was approaching with my car, but the deer expedited the process. &amp;#x200B; **Model Y (new) - Long Range** I honestly had not been tracking daily prices of the cars, and hadn't looked at what theses were going for for about a year or more. In my head I was assuming we were going to be putting down 60-70k to get what we wanted. The reality was much different, than expectation. I started by building exactly what I wanted, and going into research mode on options (there really aren't too many things to consider, surprisingly at least to me): \\- Reddit (thanks) helped me quickly realize we didn't need EAP or FSD \\- Long Range: yes please \\- Bigger ties look nice, but the moment I realized it reduced range (nope, no thanks) \\- Color: I guess I don't mind paying for blue, I like blue (personal preference) Then I found the 'inventory' tab, and noticed there were a lot of cars available. So I entered exactly what I built there, and saw I could get it sooner for $4,500 less. I don't consider myself impulsive. I bought it that night (ordered it?) I was driving the car 5 days later. $7,500 off the price from the point of sale discount from EV tax credit brought the total sale price down to the upper $30k's (wow! Half what I was expecting to pay, for a new car... I was in a good mood) &amp;#x200B; **Extras** We did have to hire a guy (licensed Electrician) to install a 110 foot line from our sub panel to the garage to put the Wall Charger in the garage. We had the foresight to install it in a way where it could hit both sides of the garage (foreshadowing) although at the time we had no idea just 6 weeks later we would be getting another Tesla. Cost $2,250 (wall charger included) &amp;#x200B; **Savings** It wasn't until the first week of driving the car (and a lot more research online - much of it here - THANK YOU!) that I started to realize just how much money I was saving from electric compared to gas. I live in Virginia, which already have a fairly low average cost per kWh... but my power company in particular charges just 9 cents per kWh, and when I changed to EV status with them, it dropped to 5 cents per kWh 11pm to 6am. I drive about 20k miles a year (mostly commuting) and much of that is winding 35mph roads that are fun to drive with beautiful scenery. I didn't realize two things when I bought the Model Y -- A) EV cars excel at savings when you're driving under 50MPH, and B) the regen breaking makes driving these roads SO much more enjoyable, safe, and efficient. The altitude change is minimal, but I'm averaging 210-220 Wh/mi after the first 15 miles of my commute every day... and hitting 190-200 on the way home for the same section. All while feeling like a kid in a goKart on these winding roads (deer, you got me here, but please please don't ruin this for me!) I did the math, and I'm going to save $3,125 annually now that I'm driving this car (electric compared to gas) vs the premium gas my 2015 ICE vehicle was consuming prior. This Model Y will pay for itself (become free) after 13 years... if I drove it that long. &amp;#x200B; **Model 3 (used)** My wife and I decided that whoever drives furthest on a given day would take the MYLR.

Tesla has had a P/S multiple between 6 and 28 historically I built a matrix pricing Tesla between 6 to 10x sales and looked at sales of 150,180,200,210,225 (-25%,-10%,base,5%,12.5%) on that revenue estimate This yields a market cap of 900 to 2,250 or a 3 year return ranging between 7.47% and 45.86% per year!

DOGE is set to terminate in July of 2026 starting the distancing from Trump For better or worse, fair or unfair, Tesla likely has a regulatory advantage in getting FSD approved thanks to Elon‚Äôs position. Overtime I expect Tesla will be valued like Apple, not legacy auto. Why? Well for one, Tesla doesn‚Äôt have a banking arm so that makes it far different than legacy auto for comparisons. Apple has lumpy iPhone sales followed by big fat juicy service revenue. Tesla, at maturity has the same potential. Lumpy car sales with subscriptions to FSD, Insurance, App Store, robo-taxi, repairs and maintenance, etc. this is the reason I used 6-10x sales above. These are around the multiple Apple has been valued at in recent years. Additionally, the following is True: They sell cars at retail prices to consumers whereas legacy auto sells cars wholesale to dealers. They are one of the few to make EVs profitable at scale and have been wise to lower prices to levels legacy auto can‚Äôt compete at. Tesla has many call options on its business with robotics and FSD Never mix politics and portfolios Best of Luck! (Please be additive to the conversation: critique my assumptions, not my character)"}

Click here to view website content [It‚Äôs Not You, It‚Äôs Your Story: Why Branding Matters](https://www.antdiy.vip/?p=951) In today‚Äôs fast-paced, overly-automated, and digitally-driven society, humanity is becoming the new premium. The internet constantly rewards us with convenience and instant gratification, making the human touch increasingly more scarce and coveted. In this environment, businesses can no longer afford to be faceless entities. To survive, businesses need to connect with audiences, pull at their heartstrings, and engage with them on a much deeper level than seen before. That‚Äôs where brand storytelling comes in. Brand storytelling is the cohesive narrative that weaves together the facts and emotions that your brand evokes. In addition to giving your customers reasons why they should buy a product or service, businesses need to start sharing the story behind their brand, why it exists, and why this matters, consistently across all communication. Brand storytelling is no longer a nice to have. It is a need to have, and what will ultimately maximize your business‚Äôs visibility, profit, and impact. Treat it as a compass for your marketing strategy, and the result will be a brand that is as profitable as it is captivating. &amp;#x200B; ## table of Contents * Consumers Recognize Your Brand * Consumers Trust Your Brand * Consumers Feel Connected to Your Brand * You Can Shape Customer Perception * Your Brand is your Proposition for Disruption * More than customers, build a tribe * You have got to Unleash Your Rebel Voice. * In a sea of sameness, be unforgettable. # Consumers Recognize Your Brand One of the main reasons you should build a brand in the first place is so that consumers can recognize your business. Ultimately, you want your customers to see one of your ads and immediately know it‚Äôs from your business, even if your logo or business name is nowhere to be found. When consumers are at this point, it means that they truly know your brand. When people recognize your brand on their social media feeds or billboards around the city, they are more likely to think of your brand when they are ready to make a purchase. For this reason, your brand should be consistent across all marketing channels ‚Äî traditional and digital. Your brand should also tie into your product/service experience. When branding is done right, consumers feel certain emotions when seeing your brand. For example, if you have an adventurous brand, consumers should be inspired to run up the closest mountain upon seeing your ad. If your brand is more nostalgic, certain happy memories should be triggered by your brand. A consistent brand also includes customer experiences. Consumers who interact with your brand should see your brand values in action when they make a purchase, and they should be able to recall those values when they see your logo. When you are recognizable to your customers, it sets you apart from the competition. Ultimately, you want your customers to see one of your ads and immediately know it‚Äôs from your business, even if your logo or business name is nowhere to be found. # Consumers Trust Your Brand People stick with brands because the brands are predictable. Even if the consumers know they aren‚Äôt getting the best service, there is comfort in knowing exactly what to expect. Humans feel better about a company when they can anticipate its next moves. When it comes to brand consistency, predictability is critical. Consistency makes consumers trust your brand, and that consistency leads to more positive feelings toward your brand.

Not way better, but better. As many here predicted, they put on a quality session which I think largely helped to sway investor sentiment to the positive. I like to think that the quality of these meetings (and the earnings calls) is borne by their honesty and transparency. I know some investors believe they have not been honest. I think Sumit's willingness to spend 3 hours at the Happy Hour meeting also contributed to the honesty and transparency. While I believe they have made some mistakes and misjudged the sales process in general and even more specifically the automotive sales process, I do not believe they have been dishonest. Having said that, it is management‚Äôs job to shine an optimistic light on the situation, the degree to which that is done is always the question. The line between optimism and dishonestly lies within the eye of the beholder. Obviously, for those of you who were not able to attend, you can watch the video recording. Some of the comments below are simply a recap of the Q&amp;A session with some of my color commentary added. #**TL;DR** Peppered throughout the RID, there were quite a few references to being close to closing a deal in the industrial space. Sumit said his expectation was to close an industrial deal before September. They are making investments for the future ‚Äì sensor fusion and military. This could be a signal that they believe there will be a future! ;-) Meaning they expect to close some industrial deals soon. In summary, I think their plan for the rest of this year is‚Ä¶ 1. Close an industrial deal or deals soon 2. Hope the stock price appreciates asymmetrically 3. Raise a round of capital 4. Get some kind of early traction in the military vertical and hope for more asymmetry in the stock price 5. Exploit the edge perception and sensor fusion for the industrial vertical (sensor fusion may be 2026) 6. If they can throw in some sort of news in the automotive space that would be a bonus. #**Sumit‚Äôs lesson learned** The very first question for Sumit was what mistakes has he made? He said he underestimated the technology adoption (this is essentially the sales process). I would say that it is very common for someone who is transitioning from the technology world to the sales world. That is, most of the time, the general thought is that a good product will win, perhaps even sell itself. Generally, it takes some tough real-world experiences to learn that isn‚Äôt usually the case. #**Military** Military ‚Äì the strategy here is that Microvision already owns a number of the building blocks that can be used to create appropriate products. In other words they are not starting from scratch. The other aspect, as Anubhav mentioned, there is a lot of investment flowing into defense tech these days so Microvision wants to be in a position to take advantage of this. A question was asked about whether or not Microvision is going direct to the DoD or will work via a prime. Sumit said one of his lessons learned is you must have direct access to the buyer. Therefore, for military business, Microvision must let the DoD know what products they have and what problems they solve. They still intend to partner with a prime in order to go-to-market. They need to crawl, walk, and then potentially run. Glen mentioned it is a changing landscape with regard to the military needs and their sourcing practices. What are the applications for which Microvision has a fit? Autonomous vehicles and sensor fusion. Drones ‚Äì over the last 3 to 5 years there has been a massive expansion in drones for surveying, mapping, and detection. Microvision would need to repackage their sensor to be light weight. Solid state is important. Do drones require 360 degrees of FOV? There is a lot of fidelity required looking down ‚Äì so 180 degrees of FOV needed.

Hey all, I've had my 2022 ES 300h Ultra Luxury for just over 7 months now, and I just don't love it. There's a lot to like, but I never truly loved it for several reasons. When I was shopping for a car, I knew I wanted a hybrid or EV, so I used the MSRPs of Tesla Model 3, Toyota Camry, and Honda Accord to set my budget. I didn't like any of these, so started looking for used Lexus ES 300H in the same price range. I put a $35k CAD down payment on a $58k CAD car (that includes all taxes and fees), thinking I'd pay off the rest in about a year. I felt sick to my stomach after splashing such a big amount of money on a car, and the guilt has been eating me up ever since. My monthly payment is $552, which is not great, though not the worst either. But, I just can't fathom doing this for 3.5 more years, let alone make a $20k lump sum to pay off the loan. I test drove a 2017 GS 350 on two different occasions and enjoyed the smooth V6 and higher build quality. It's like they cheaped out a lot with the ES interior. I saw one today with the Executive package for $28k with 110k kms and test drove it. It comes with winter tires and a second set of wheels. Not a bad price, but the dealer lowballed me with a trade-in value of a whopping $38k, when I know for a fact that the value ranges from $38k-$49k for the model year and trim, and I showed the manager that this value came straight from AutoTrader, yet they acted dumb and \"oh this looks way different than our valuation, what could the reason be?\" I know the deal with wholesale values and all, but considering the fact that I have brand new winter tires, extended warranty, and 23k kms on the odometer, I think that figure is unfair and expected at least $45k from a Lexus dealer. They'll have no problem selling it for the same price they sold it to me or more and still make a profit. They seemed like they were willing to work on their valuation, but I wasn't prepared to fold and commit to a purchase on the spot. Tl;dr, am I stupid to trade in a perfectly good, economical car for one that will essentially be paid off, even though it is obviously more dated, driven way more, and is a gas guzzler? Moral of the story is that I realized that I would much rather pay cash for a car than have the burden of a monthly payment on my shoulders."}

First, an important preface... \\--- # Who am I and why is this initial impressions review worth reading? Based out of Los Angeles in Southern California, I've spent the last few years actively involved in the PEV community, primarily focused on full-on electric vehicles‚ÄîI daily drive a Tesla Model 3, so my normal commute is also powered by an electric motor‚Äîbut honed in on electric scooters. My miles have been accrued on everything from the wide roster of Segway-Ninebot consumer models, to more niche and high-performing Nami and Wolf models out in the wild. As Los Angeles has a mature rideshare network in place, I've also put in countless miles/hours on varying models from Bird, Spin, Evo, etc. Given Segway's rise to stardom in the industry, I planned on purchasing a pair of Ninebot Max scooters (one for me and one for my wife) at the tail-end of last year, but when Segway announced the GT and P Series earlier this year, I kicked my research into high gear, connecting with active people in the r/ElectricScooters subreddit and various others to try and gain as much of a pre-purchase education as possible. My personal use-case and goal were to arrive upon the best possible option for a city explorer, versatile eScooter, loaded with tech, capable of robust top-speed, and toward the top of the charts in terms of efficiency/range. While I may use my eScooter for occasional commutes, my general purpose is recreational riding, exploration, and light errand running across LA's Westside. When Segway finalized the spec sheet and launched the Kickstarter, my wife and I pulled the trigger on a pair of P100S. Fortunate to be based out of Los Angeles, our units were day-one deliveries, taking just a single day to go from Segway's Katy, Texas distribution center to our home address. \\--- # The Personal Rider Details to Consider: * Rider Weight (Total payload during miles tested as of this writing): 165 lbs * Ambient Temperatures (during miles tested as of this writing): 70-78 F * Road Surfaces/Types Tested: Primarily city/residential (newly paved and older, rougher), along with light trail (dirt and sand) * Hill Grades Tested: Flat ground, steep descents, and 20+% hill climbs * Miles Ridden on P100S as of 10/1/22: 68.6 miles * P100S units on-hand and mileage distribution between them: Two units on-hand, with 50/50 mileage distribution between them \\--- # Segway P100S Essential Specs: * Range: 33.9 miles under near-max performance ride mode or \\~60 miles under full eco ride mode (more on this in a dedicated section later) * Motor Type and Output: 650 W single motor with 1350 W peak output * Brakes: 5.5\" ventilated, mechanical disc brakes with rear electric regen brake * Acceleration and Top Speed: 0-15 in 2.8 seconds, with a 30 MPH top speed * Hill Grade Capability: 23% * Total Payload Capacity: 265 lbs * Suspension: Front &amp; Rear Dedicated Suspension (Torsion-Bar Type) * Tires: Automobile-grade 10.5\" pneumatic all season (tubeless, self-sealing) * Battery Pack: 1086 wH * Charge Time (0-100%): \\~7 hours * Water Rating: IPX5 body and IPX7 battery pack * Lighting: 10 W LED daytime running light, multicolor RGB accent lights, Segway welcome light (rear puddle lights), full turn signal lights (front and rear"}

JLR provides some strength, but the PV and CV segments dilute overall pricing ability. Pricing Structure **- Passenger Vehicles (PV):** Limited pricing power in the mass-market segment because competition is intense.

PV and CV segments operate on thin margins (5-8%), heavily influenced by input costs and competition. Capital Intensity- Asset-light businesses are favoured as they require less reinvestment and scale more efficiently. Tata Motors **Capital intensity is high, which reduces free cash flow scalability.** **Automobiles are inherently capital-intensive**..Tata Motors invests heavily in R&amp;D (6-7% of revenue) and manufacturing facilities, especially for EVs.**The EV business requires significant upfront capital for battery manufacturing, charging infrastructure, and product development.** Free Cash Flow (FCF)- High and consistent FCF generation is critical for reinvestment and shareholder returns. Tata Motors FCF is improving but inconsistent because of the cyclical nature and high reinvestment needs.**Positive FCF generation was supported by better operating cash flow from JLR in the past few yearsand this led to the spike in stock price**, **but recently JLR has cut the FCF guidance by 30% due to high capex.

Older videos feel a lot more like a big group of friends just fucking around, paying a bunch of money and giving it away to ACTUAL strangers. This goes along with something else I‚Äôve seen on this subreddit, in the newer videos, the OG crew just doesn‚Äôt seem very happy or excited and everything feels forced. While I don‚Äôt think thats entirely true, it‚Äôs super easy to see why. The new videos just don‚Äôt put the focus on them, they only put a focus on creating a story, making a challenge, having some random character accomplish the mission while Jimmy leads, with the rest of the group acting as background characters. This is almost a complete 180 from what was seen in older videos: the GROUP was the focus, them fucking around and being friends was the entertainment. It felt real not because they weren‚Äôt depressed or because of something behind the scenes, instead it felt real because‚Ä¶ it was. It was a group of guys hanging out, doing stupid shit with their rich friend, giving away money and inviting others to join, letting their own humor and personalities shine too. Compare that to today where most guests are either from older videos or already have great experience in social media; and with the focus not being on the group, but instead being on the story of the video, and keeping younger audiences engaged throughout. It doesn‚Äôt feel true not necessarily because it‚Äôs entirely fake, but because it isn‚Äôt a group of guys hanging out anymore. It‚Äôs not the type of video though, MrBeast has been making challenge and ‚Äúworlds most expensive‚Äù videos ever since his start, among other things. But a clear difference is the production value. Modern MrBeast is a brand and company, so every video had a high production value and TEAMS of employees to make sure everything is right. Older videos instead seemed very on the spot and obviously, much cheaper. In my opinion, I prefer the older content because of this fact. The newer videos don‚Äôt feel like their being made by friends, they feel like their being made by a company and large teams of people, who are also pushing products to me. The newer videos feel corporate and oddly fake to me. His older videos instead feel like they were made by friends, though they were cheaper, they felt much more real and relatable. Even in his more expensive videos such as ‚Äúopening the worlds cheapest store‚Äù or ‚Äúlast to leave Tesla‚Äù the focus was still on the friends and the group, plus those helped because of their actions. It felt relatable without feeling too corporate. But is that really a bad thing though? After all MrBeast is a brand now, not just a person or a group. And attempting to push more towards younger ages is never a bad thing, plus all of the philanthropy work Jimmy has done is simply incredible. In the past, MrBeast was definitely for a little more older audiences, but now it‚Äôs being pushed to much younger children. Is that bad? Absolutely not, but it means that some of his older audiences simply outgrew him, especially after growing up on what he had to offer years prior. Which is why I think he simply isn‚Äôt the same anymore. He isn‚Äôt awful or even bad now, one can argue he‚Äôs still very entertaining even for older audiences, but he‚Äôs definitely not the same as he was back then."}

[Summer Solstice 2019 edition](https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/c3f10u/arbitrary_list_of_popular_lights_summer_solstice/) Happy Solstice! Praise Ra! Now, please bring back the sun. Well, I guess most of us here don't **really** need it anyway. In honor of Winter Solstice for the northern hemisphere, I've made an updated list of popular lights. Today is the day you're most likely to need a flashlight if you're north of the equator. Because a definitive buyer's guide is too hard, I've made an arbitrary list of popular lights you should consider if you're shopping for a light. There is no best flashlight, so this is not the last word in what's good, but a list of lights that are often bought or recommended here with a touch of my own opinion thrown in. Exclusion from this list doesn't mean a light isn't good. Briefly, here are some characteristics that are usually considered desirable. Most of the recommended lights won't have all of them, but these are things to look for when shopping for lights: * Neutral white tint - the [vast majority](https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/5yjqcr/poll_preferred_color_temperature/) of people with an opinion prefer a color temperature that's within the range of direct sunlight, which is generally marketed as \"neutral white\", but sometimes as \"warm white\" * A lack of red, or especially green off-tints, beam artifacts and tint shift from the center of the beam to the edges * A user interface that does not require cycling through different modes to turn off, and does not change modes every time the light is turned off * A lack of blinking modes within the standard mode rotation, either because the light doesn't have any, or they're \"hidden\" by being accessed in a different manner than the usual modes * An IP waterproofing rating - most good lights are rated for IPX8 with the depth and duration of submersion specified by the manufacturer * A lack of timed stepdowns. Some lights only produce their maximum output for a few minutes at a time. While some powerful lights can get too hot to hold if run on high constantly, the hardware necessary to measure temperature and only reduce power if the light is actually too hot costs only a few cents, but many lights won't overheat badly anyway * Full-spectrum, or high-CRI for more accurate color rendering. Color rendering index, or CRI is the most common measurement of this; average LEDs are about 70. Over 80 is decent, and over 90 is excellent. The highest I've heard of from an LED is [99](http://budgetlightforum.com/node/60236). This is more important for seeing detail than absolute output and can be the difference between a stick and a snake on the trail. * A sub-lumen moonlight mode (for general-use lights) * A user interface that allows access to the lowest and highest modes from off without having to cycle through other modes * A user interface where a single click turns the light on in a reasonable mode, and another single click turns it off. # About specs Lumens are total output. Don't worry about small differences in output. You probably can't detect a 10% difference in lumens with your eyes, and 20% is barely noticeable. It takes 4 times the lumens to look twice as bright. Candela is intensity, which translates to throw distance. FL1 throw numbers are about right for detecting large objects; cut them in half for seeing clearly. Extreme throw distances also run in to limits imposed by human vision and by backscatter in the atmosphere. Warmer tints have less backscatter. FL1 runtime numbers are to 10% output and can be misleading. Look for a review with a runtime graph. Performance specs for AA and AAA powered lights are usually given with NiMH rechargeable batteries. Alkalines don't perform as well, and may leak corrosive electrolyte. If you want something particularly powerful or long-lasting, you should probably skip right to the [18650](ht"}

Here are the strategies that the world's richest man used to built PayPal, Tesla, SpaceX, Starlink and X.AI. Plus the super prompt you can use to founder like Elon As someone who's always been fascinated by how visionaries turn wild ideas into world-changing realities, I dove deep into Elon Musk's story. Drawing from Walter Isaacson's gripping 2023 biography *Elon Musk* and the insightful Founders Podcast video \"How Elon Works,\" I wanted to create something truly valuable for this community. This isn't just a list ‚Äì it's a comprehensive guide packed with actionable insights and real-world examples from Musk's companies. Why Musk? He's not just the richest person alive but a master builder. His strategies aren't about luck ‚Äì they're about relentless execution, first-principles thinking, and pushing humanity forward. This post aims to be helpful (practical steps), inspirational (stories of overcoming odds), educational (backed by data and history), and comprehensive (deep dives into each tactic). To set the stage, here‚Äôs a quick table of his key companies: |Company|Founded|Key Milestones|2025 Valuation (Approx.)|Musk's Role/Ownership| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |**PayPal**|1998|2002: Sold to eBay for $1.5B; revolutionized online payments.|\\~$70B (public market cap)|Co-founder; sold stake post-acquisition.| |**Tesla**|2003|2010: IPO; 2024: Cybertruck launch; 2025: Robotaxi unveil.|\\~$815B (market cap)|CEO; \\~12% ownership (\\~$98B value).| |**SpaceX**|2002|2008: First private orbital launch; 2025: Mars cargo mission planned. Starlink: 6M+ subscribers.|$350B (SpaceX total); Starlink subset \\~$75B|Founder/CEO; \\~42% ownership (\\~$147B value).| |**Neuralink**|2016|2023: Human trials approved; 2025: First commercial implants.|\\~$5-8B (private est.)|Co-founder; majority stake.| |**The Boring Co.**|2016|2021: Vegas Loop operational; 2025: Chicago O'Hare expansion.|\\~$6B (private est.)|Founder; majority stake.| |**xAI**|2023|2023: Grok AI launch; 2025: $5B funding round.|$113B|Founder; \\~54% ownership (\\~$61B value).| # 1. Question Every Requirement Musk's core philosophy: Never accept \"requirements\" blindly. In the biography, he insists every rule must trace back to a person ‚Äì even if it's him ‚Äì and be challenged. This stems from first-principles thinking, breaking problems to fundamentals. Example: At SpaceX, Musk questioned NASA's rocket cost norms, leading to the \"idiot index\" (raw material cost vs. final product). Result? Falcon 9 costs dropped from $60M to $2.7M per launch. At Tesla, he grilled suppliers on battery specs, slashing Model 3 production costs by 30%. Inspirational Angle: Musk arrived in the US with nothing but turned Zip2 (his first company) into a $307M sale by questioning outdated mapping tech. \"When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor,\" he says. Data Viz: SpaceX Launch Cost Reduction (ASCII Chart): $60M | ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà (Pre-Musk norms) $2.7M| ‚ñà (Falcon 9, 2020s) Application: In your startup, audit every process ‚Äì e.g., why use expensive software? Challenge it weekly to cut waste by 20-50%. # 2. Delete Any Part of the Process You Can Musk's mantra: Delete ruthlessly, then add back only 10% if needed. This fights bureaucracy and bloat. Example: At Twitter (now X), post-acquisition in 2022, he deleted 75% of staff and features, streamlining to focus on core. At The Boring Company, he deleted complex tunnel designs, reducing Vegas Loop costs to $10M/mile vs. $1B/mile for traditional subways. Educational Insight: Isaacson notes this led to SpaceX's reusable rockets ‚Äì deleting disposable parts saved billions. Starlink's 6,000+ satellites launched cheaply because Musk deleted over-engineering. Inspirational: After PayPal's sale, Musk could've retired but deleted comfort to start SpaceX, risking everything. Quote: \"A common mistake is to simplify and optimize a part or a process that should not exist\". T"}

Tesla bulls cheered after one of the worst earnings reports in company history (maybe even *the* worst). Here is the high level takeaway from Barron's: \"*Tesla stock is surging, but make no mistake: The quarter wasn‚Äôt good. The stock reaction is more of a lesson in expectations and the stock market rather than a financial one.* *Sales, operating profit, and net income fell 9%, 66%, and 39% year over year. That belies how weak the EV business is currently. From peak quarterly levels, Tesla‚Äôs sales are 25% lower and net income is 77% lower. First-quarter operating profit is down 90% from a fourth-quarter 2022 peak of $3.9 billion.*\" (Source: [Tesla: Just How Bad Was This Quarter?](https://www.barrons.com/livecoverage/tesla-earnings-stock-price-musk/card/just-how-bad-was-this-quarter)) I keep using my facetious tech-jargony term: ERDF (Elon Reality Distortion Field) to explain how Elon can overcome even the worst news with hype. But it is a real thing! And it really works. Here is the bottom line if you are a Tesla bull: Elon can tell the markets to ignore all of 2025, plummeting sales, self-created political drama and chaos, complete lack of focus in his leadership at the company, brand damage, endless delays, failed product launches (e.g., Cybertruck), rising competition, need to replace 4M computers in their cars to get anything resembling FSD so they don't get sued (again), and losing 90% of the company's operating profit and turn it into a juicy buying opportunity. The ticker doesn't lie. The stock goes up as the profit goes down (dramatically), driving the P/E ratio even further away from reality, now approaching jaw-dropping \\~150x. And the stock still going up this morning. Bulls win. Again. For those of us outside the grip of the ERDF, here is my take on the earnings: It was basically a used Kleenex being used by Elon to clean up his \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ (you fill in the blank in the comments- make us laugh). It was the same old news being reused to wipe away the reality of a failing and desperate company. **----End main post. Begin TLDR analysis. Don't read it if you are just going to complain----** Below is one obvious fact, three used Kleenex, and what I see priced into the stock at this time: **Fact:** Trump is indeed giving Elon the widely expected quid pro quo deal for buying him the White House. Remember the tariff \"news\" that was released right at the same time Tesla's horrid sales numbers were released a few weeks ago? Well, we got the same thing for the predictable dumpster fire of an earnings report yesterday. Trump is moving the macro elements in the markets by timing his \"tariff on/off\" switch to boost a single stock of the company owned by the person that got him elected. It's simple: Elon buys Trump the White House. Trump buys Elon more time to make is car company \"not-a-car-company\" by keeping the stock pumped. Elon is acting as a heat shield for Trump by doing the dirty work of cutting jobs with DOGE and Trump is acting as a heat shield for Tesla's stock. I bet we will see another White House sales special when the \"low cost\" car comes up for sale too. **Used Kleenex #1:** ERDF has achieved FSD mode as long as Elon keeps his hand on the wheel 2-3 days out of the week for Tesla. The news that was already known by the law mandates the term for Special Advisors to the President be limited to 130-days per calendar year, was deployed again. This same (not actual news) news release was already made and already got the stock to pop. But Elon isn't really leaving. According to the man himself, he is still going to be splitting his time between DOGE and Tesla, giving each a few days a week. And don't forget about SpaceX, X, xAI, Neuralink, The Boring Company, 14-kids and counting, and all the other stuff he spends his time on like gaming. But trust him: He is really going to focus this time. Seriously guys. **Used Kleenex #2:** Tesla is now going to"}

Here's everything we've learned. Enjoy! We wanted to really [deconstruct the phenomenon of word-of-mouth](http://www.referralcandy.com/blog/how-to-get-word-of-mouth) and explain it in a way that's easy for entrepreneurs to understand. We read all the books‚Äì [Made To Stick](http://www.referralcandy.com/blog/made-to-stick), Tipping Point, [Contagious](http://www.referralcandy.com/blog/contagious), Unleashing The Ideavirus, you name it. And we've been analyzing everything from Fortune 500 companies to new ideas on Kickstarter. Here's what we've learnt. # There are 3 parts to getting word-of-mouth: 1. Make a Wow product that's actually worth talking about 2. Seed the Wow ‚Äì make sure it gets into the hands of people who'll love to talk about it 3. Just Add Grease ‚Äì make it as easy as possible for people to talk about you So let's start with WOW. # There are two things that go into a Wow: 1. [Unexpected Utility](http://www.referralcandy.com/blog/unexpected-utility-word-of-mouth-marketing/) (innovation), and 2. a [Meaningful Story](http://www.referralcandy.com/blog/storytelling-in-marketing-11-examples/) (marketing). Let's go through examples of each. # MAKE A WOW PRODUCT, PT 1: CREATE UNEXPECTED UTILITY A product has Unexpected Utility when it solves a specific problem better than most people had previously thought possible, and at a lower price than people might've imagined it to cost. # Examples of Unexpected Utility in a New Product Class &gt; \"What we want to do is make a leapfrog product that is way smarter than any mobile device has ever been, and super-easy to use. This is what (the) iPhone is. \" - Steve Jobs in 2007, launching the iPhone ## Apple iPhone Like the iPod before it, the iPhone broke into a new class of products. It allowed people to do more with their mobile device than they were ever able to before. This made it immensely newsworthy, despite its initial flaws. As of March 2015, over 700,000,000 iPhones have been sold. ## Other Examples * [Dropbox](http://www.referralcandy.com/blog/dropbox) * [Tesla Model S](http://www.referralcandy.com/blog/tesla) * Lily cam # Examples of Unexpected Utility by being Extreme / Best In Class &gt; \"The public tends to be, as they should, interested in things that are precedent and superlatives.\" ‚Äì Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla Motors &amp; SpaceX ## Coolest Cooler Why would anybody want to talk about a cooler? It's a box that you put your drinks in. Well, the Coolest Cooler does much more than that‚Äì it's got Bluetooth speakers, a blender, a USB charger, an LED lid light... and that's not even half of it. They raised $13 million dollars on Kickstarter‚Äì260 times their $50,000 target. ## Other Examples: * Under Armour * Early Google # MAKE A WOW PRODUCT, PT 2: TELL A MEANINGFUL STORY &gt; \"At the end of the day, brand helps customers answer THE question, Which one should I buy?\" ‚Äì Marc Barros, Contour co-founder. If you want more word-of-mouth, you need to figure out what your story is. It needs to be simple and sticky, so that people who love you know what to say about you. You can't leave this one up to chance. According to startup icon 'FAKE GRIMLOCK', there are 3 questions you need to answer to develop a 'Minimum Viable Personality': 1. How do you change your customer's life? 2. What do you stand for? 3. What do you hate? # Examples of Meaningful Storytelling: ## GoldieBlox GoldieBlox isn't pitched as just another toy marketed at girls. Rather, it's sold as a movement, a way of improving the world by correcting the gender inequality in engineering. They raised over $285,000 on Kickstarter, smashing their $150,000 goal. ## Other examples * Everlane * TOMS * GoPro # SEED DISCOVERY ‚Äì PUT THE WOW IN THE RIGHT HANDS &gt; \"Sell one.

I'm Samik Chatterjee, the analyst at JPMorgan here. For the next company at the tech forum, we have the pleasure of hosting BlackBerry. BlackBerry has transformed from a smartphone manufacturer to a leading security-focused enterprise software and services provider. The BlackBerry‚Äôs portfolio competes in a number of interesting markets, including cyber security, automotive software and critical event management. Today, we will be focusing more on BlackBerry's automotive software, which is QNX. It is my pleasure to introduce Steve Rai, BlackBerry's Chief Financial Officer; and John Wall, BlackBerry's Co-Head of BlackBerry Technology Solutions. And thank you both, Steve and John for attending and participating in this conference. Look forward to an interesting discussion. I will probably just start you off here, Steve, in a sense,* we- before we dive into Q&amp;A for the benefit of investors, reengaging with the BlackBerry story, who probably know BlackBerry from a smartphone days more, can we just start with a high-level overview of the business today? Steve Rai Sure.* Thank you, and pleased to be here today. So, while we don't build phones anymore, we absolutely continue to leverage the strong software and security heritage of the company. Our trusted software platform, which we call Spark, can connect, secure and manage every endpoint in the IoT landscape. So, it leverages next-gen threat protection, intelligent security, and provides a single pane of glass to manage the environment. Further, through AI and machine learning, it continues to get smarter and provides excellent return on investment. So, this area represents a $38 billion and growing addressable market. Beyond securing enterprises, our solutions also enable critical infrastructure such as securing utilities, automotive safety through QNX, which as John will speak to, and securing people through our AtHoc critical event management solution. We've got deep credentials which have been hardened in the regulated space. At nearly all of the G20 governments and top 10 global banks as well as the top 9 automotive OEMs, we've got them as customers. Our solutions are equally applicable and provide significant value to enterprises of all sizes. So, I believe all this and the strong financial position of the company, of course, sets us up very well to serve the markets that we‚Äôre in*. And it plays right into the macro trends that we're seeing, including an ever-increasing mobile and work-from-anywhere workforce, rapid IoT proliferation, and an ever-increasing threat landscape, which, of course, the unprecedented cyberattacks of 2020 underscore, and the evolution of vehicles and smart city infrastructure that John Wall will speak to. Question-and-Answer Session Q - Samik Chatterjee So, before I kind of move on to some of the other markets, let's kind of hit on QNX and the inbuilt software offering here.

Polestar is the only global EV ‚Äòpure play,‚Äô other than Tesla. https://preview.redd.it/ygvdc21kkey71.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=672e1bcea882eaa1694dc3b3bf45dfa6edcd2eae **History** A little background‚Ä¶ * ‚ÄúPolestar‚Äù takes its name from the North Star, or Polaris ‚Äî not the resourceful co-ed grinding the early-evening shift at the Spearmint Rhino. That‚Äôs *Polstj√§rnan* (literal translation, ‚ÄúPole Star‚Äù) if you‚Äôre Swedish. * Polestar was started in 1996 by Volvo‚Äôs partner, Flash/Polestar Racing. * Volvo acquired Polestar in 2015. Volvo had itself been acquired in 2010 by Geely, a China-based auto brand that sells vehicles under the brands Geely Auto, Lotus, Lynk &amp; Co, Proton, and Volvo. Geely sold over 2.4 million cars in 2020. * Volvo and Geely describe the Polestar brand as being ‚Äúindependent since 2017.‚Äù * Polestar is co-owned by Volvo and Geely, and headquartered in Gothenburg, Sweden. * Polestar is now being taken public at a $20B valuation by the Gores-Guggenheim SPAC, GGPI. **Comps** https://preview.redd.it/cjhasg7skey71.jpg?width=1242&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a57236ff26ed8ae0b2910d0bbfee3b24ddf0605 **GGPI is trading at a significant discount to TSLA and LCID, based on EV/sales multiples.** * Applying Tesla‚Äôs 2022E multiple (17.2x) to Polestar implies a share price of $27.46. As GGPI is currently trading at $10.70, this yields an increase of 156.64%. * Applying Lucid‚Äôs 2022E multiple (29.6x) to Polestar implies a share price of $47.27. As GGPI is currently trading at $10.70, this yields an increase of 342.78%. https://preview.redd.it/ginl0ciukey71.jpg?width=1297&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=779eef17f69c5acd516425d3d8a0ae10494552a0 **Peer Multiples -- EV Pure Plays** * GGPI is essentially valued at the same forward multiples as XPEV and NIO. * Bear in mind, XPEV and NIO are higher-risk companies that deserve valuation discounts because: 1. The CCP can theoretically shut them down at any moment without warning (see: $DIDI). 2. The stocks are actually ADRs and based in the Cayman Islands, so you don't even own the actual companies. * By comparison, GGPI is headquartered in Sweden and already US-listed on the Nasdaq. * Polestar is already an established OEM, leveraging the strategic relationship with Volvo in manufacturing, design and marketing. Hence, the investment opportunity is lower risk since Polestar is not a start-up. * As with most present-day multinationals, there is some China-related production risk. However, Polestar is addressing the issue by opening US factories going forward. &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/8kt1miyxkey71.png?width=588&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e771bc7dd377abf7233926b3302c0bc76d57b85 &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/dv6nu4o0ley71.jpg?width=554&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed57210e7fd7d962b18952e56d361074f702e832 **Gores SPACs** For those new to SPACland, Gores‚Äô track record speaks for itself‚Ä¶ https://preview.redd.it/nuvx0647ley71.jpg?width=1972&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7cb66ac0a639c150a9f8845d6eb764a0438fd01d **The EV Graveyard** The EV SPAC battlefield is littered with bodies (RIDE, WKHS, NKLA).

Backstory: As a guy in my 50s I wanted something with a more classy interior (think suede, Napa leather, wood trim panels). So I naturally gravitated to the luxury brands (Audi/BMW/MB) but because my budget for a used (2021+) EV was under $40K I could only look at the bottom lines of those storied brands (i.e. MB EQB250/300). But those vehicles are more targeted to people in their 20s. The cockpit of the EQB is more like a star-wars cruiser rather than a classy interior. So I moved on. The EV6/Ioniq 5 platforms are great. Truly impressed with the fast charging. I rented an EV6 for a bit and I just couldn't get over how cheap the interior was. Lots of hard plastics and if I was going on road trips every weekend, I could overlook that because the DC fast charging really is about 20 minutes 20-80%. So I moved on. Mach E was nice but I wanted more luxury (i.e. HUD, Napa, Bose audio). So I moved on. Toyota/Subarua's twins just looked weird on the interior. So I moved on. I'm a VAG guy. the e-tron (like a lot of Audi's) isn't a good value proposition and the ID.4 just had too many glitches. I actually first looked at these 12 months ago when I was getting my car serviced but there was a stop-sell order on all 2023 models and VW bought back all of the cars of the dealer lot. Another 2024 stop sell order put me off them. So I relucantly looked at the Nissan Ariya. Brand new the 2023 models were $50K-$60K and since they (after just one year) are selling for $25k-$30k, I thought they were just glorified leafs. But wow, how wrong was I. You can find a great tool that allows you to easily compare trims here [https://www.nissanusa.com/interactivebrochures/electric-hybrid-cars/ariya/ariya-trims/index.html?nav=top&amp;nav=top](https://www.nissanusa.com/interactivebrochures/electric-hybrid-cars/ariya/ariya-trims/index.html?nav=top&amp;nav=top) You'll see even the base trim has HUD and a classy interior. The vehicle is everything you'd expect in a luxury trim EV under $50K but it's a Nissan. My top of the line Platinum+ has a Bose Audio, Nappa leather, Seude inserts, active noise canellation, HUD, Ventillated seats and the self driving is a nice feature, but the follow-the-car-in-front-of you feature is the one I use every other day when stuck in traffic. I would have never thought it would, but it makes your commute so less stressful. There are downsides of course. The at home Level 2 charging is capped at 7.2 kw so the bigger 87kw/h battery takes a good 12+ hours to charge. The fast charging on paper looks bad (max 130kw) but as many have stated (and I found) it holds that maximum at even 50+% SOC. So I can fast charge 20-80 in about 35% so twice as slow as an Hyundai/Kia/Tesla. And of course, Nissan is viewed as a cheap car so you won't impress anyone at the country-club. A hidden benefit of the Ariya is that for any CPO version you can add a \"CPO Wrap\" for about $2K which gives you a very thorough (almost) bumper-to-bumper warranty for $2k for 7y/100k miles. Given all the electronics in these things (even the steering column is electronic) it should pay for itself. Anyway, go ahead and ask questions!"}

Time and time again, investors have been burned by trying to pick big winners and by overcomplicating a strategy that can be made very simple. I think this is about to happen to Chris Camillo if he strays from his main strategy and tries blending his self labeled ‚Äòsocial arbitrage‚Äô strategy with this idea of chasing the big humanoid robot investment. When personal vehicles powered by combustion first hit the market, people really underestimated just how ubiquitous cars would become. Yet, between 1890 and 1930, if you invested in a car company, you almost certainly went broke. In the U.S. alone, there were over 2,000 auto companies founded between 1890 and 1930. Basically all of which are now defunct other than maybe a handful. Studebaker was the household name, and ‚Äòsafest‚Äô car maker investment set to benefit from this revolution. Investors in Studebaker lost it all. Then came TVs. And it was the same story. Not a single American TV maker was a winning investment, even though every single household in the world has a tv. This time is not different. Then cell phones and the internet. Almost all of the companies that looked like big winners with big brand recognition proved to be poor investments in this time. Even Intel, which was believed to be the ‚Äòpicks and shovels‚Äô investment of the internet boom, ended up being a losing investment. ‚ÄòIntel Inside‚Äô was a brand that every single person in the world knew and trusted BEFORE the internet and computer age really took off, but people didn‚Äôt see AMD traversing Intel‚Äôs moat so easily. Tech bros believed that no matter which internet company succeeded, they would do so using Intel. Buffett was one of the ONLY major investors to come out of the internet boom a winner. While everyone lost their shirts in 2000-2001, Buffett crushed it. You might look back and think investments like Google were such obvious winners in 2004. Everyone was using them! Yet, if you bought Domino‚Äôs Pizza in 2004 instead of Google, your returns would have been better for the next 20 years. It is a dangerous game trying to pick winners, even when you‚Äôre right. For over 100 years, value has proven to consistently be the best strategy. Yet, Chris Camillo(and many others) are now constantly posting about investing in humanoid robot companies. Specifically Tesla for its Optimus tech. This is almost certainly going to lead to underperformance. There are countless startups doing this and Tesla‚Äôs moat is likely not as strong as it appears. Even though humanoid robots may change the world, trying to pick the company that will be the best investment will be a huge gamble, All that being said, I gave Camillo‚Äôs book a read yesterday and I listened to a couple podcast episodes he‚Äôs appeared on. His bread and butter is a form of very simple value investing, he just doesn‚Äôt brand it that way. His main strategy requires 3 basic metrics: 1 - Be extremely confident in the consumer behaviour of a very simple business. 2 - Invest early. 3 - Invest heavy. Number 1 is really a Buffett principle. Invest in something that is super simple, and easy to understand. If you can see that there‚Äôs an obvious high demand for something and you are extremely confident in your thesis, go for it. Number 2 is about paying a cheap price. If you know the economics of a business are currently booming(or about to), but the price hasn‚Äôt reflected it, obviously it‚Äôs a good deal. This means NVDA, CVNA, PLTR etc‚Ä¶ are probably no longer holdings of Chris Camillo‚Äôs. Number 3 is also a Buffett principle. Diversity is only protection against ignorance. The higher your conviction, the more concentrated you should be. I think Camillo‚Äôs strategy of gathering data from social media trends is actually quite brilliant and could potentially save value investors from being TOO early. Value investors tend to jump on price drops when they know the economics are likely return"}
