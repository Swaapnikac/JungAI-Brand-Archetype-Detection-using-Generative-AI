Harley-Davidson’s vision statement and mission statement provide insight into the company’s strategies and business growth path. (Photo: Public Domain) Harley-Davidson’s mission statement and vision statement focus on developing the business, in terms of products and branding. As one of the biggest motorcycle manufacturers, the company aligns its mission and vision toward strengthening its industry position and connecting with customers. Based on the corporate mission and vision statements, Harley-Davidson’s strategies and goals emphasize enhancements in products and customer relations. Thus, the corporate vision and mission statements determine the company’s strategic direction in responding to business challenges in the global motorcycle market. Harley-Davidson’s business purpose, mission, and vision guide competitiveness and organizational development. Harley-Davidson’s mission statement reflects the historical focus of the business and its role in the biker community. On the other hand, the vision statement directs the company’s strategic development as a leader in the motorcycle industry. Thus, Harley-Davidson’s vision statement includes factors that can be used as metrics for assessing the business, while the company’s mission statement focuses on a philosophical perspective about the underlying purpose and goals of the business organization. Despite this disparity, both the mission statement and the vision statement direct strategic management attention to variables for ensuring business capabilities against competition, which is a major challenge determined in the Five Forces analysis of Harley-Davidson . The vision statement underscores the importance of innovation to keep the business growing despite competition. On the other hand, Harley-Davidson’s mission statement highlights the importance of branding and motorcycle design to ensure competitiveness in the international market where many strong competitors operate. Harley-Davidson’s Mission Statement Harley-Davidson’s mission statement is “ More than building machines, we stand for the timeless pursuit of adventure. Freedom for the soul. ” This corporate mission represents the business purpose regarding the product, its utility, and its benefit to the rider. The following are the main points of Harley-Davidson’s mission statement: Manufacturing operations Product development for market demand related to adventure Beneficial experience for riders In terms of “building machines,” the mission statement refers to manufacturing operations as a foundation of Harley-Davidson’s business. Considering the company’s current products, these operations focus on motorcycle design, production, and sales. The corporate mission also indicates the pursuit of adventure, which can be used to guide Harley-Davidson’s competitive strategy and growth strategies . For example, new product development can focus on motor vehicles that satisfy target customers’ need for adventure. On the other hand, in terms of “freedom for the soul,” Harley-Davidson’s mission statement directs attention to experiential benefits for bikers. The company sees itself and its products as providers of that sense of freedom that customers experience in riding motorcycles. The applicability and practicality of this mission statement (and the vision statement) depend on external conditions, such as the economic, social, and technological factors enumerated in the PESTEL/PESTLE analysis of Harley-Davidson , which affect market response to the company and its products. For example, the relevance of the factors of adventure and experience depends on social trends influencing the transportation sector and people’s attitude toward using motorcycles for their regular mobility needs. As a result, these external factors influence strategic effectiveness and the achievement of business goals developed based on Harley-Davidson’s mission statement and its strategic "}

A brand can be forgiven for lower product quality when compared to competitor products if their brand story and identity resonates with their target audience. ‍ ‍ One such brand is Harley Davidson. They have a pretty average bike. When you assess its performance compared to competitor bikes — it’s not the fastest and it’s not the best. But it still has a loyal fan base and customers love the brand. Why? People had the same love for Coke. So when the brand introduced “New Coke”, because it did not taste good compared to Pepsi, it wasn’t received well. The company reported back to the previous product. We’ve made an article on this that you can check out here — (provide link) ‍ The journey of Harley into becoming a cultural icon So why is Harley Davidson such an iconic brand? Why is it not just a bike but became a way of life, an attribute? ‍ ‍ Harley-Davidson Motor Company was formed in 1903 by four men, led by Robert Harley, who began their operations in a small shed in the Davidson family’s backyard. People who own their product love the brand and pride themselves on owning a Harley Davidson bike. In spite of having occasional technical problems like oil leakages, people love the brand for its personality. ‍ What’s the reason behind the love of the brand? Sonny Barger, who is the founder of the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club, writes in his book the reason people love Harley Davidson, ‍ “What it’s really about with a Harley Davidson is the sound…..everybody loves that rumble. Another thing Harley owners really crave about their bikes is the low-end torque, the raw power coming out of the gate. It runs out pretty quick once you get up past ninety miles an hour. Most Harley riders don’t care about high speed, they’d rather have that low-end torque, the one the gurgles down in your groin and gives you the feeling of power. The Japanese bikes, while they have the power, they don’t quite have the feeling of power” ‍ ‍ Harley Davidson is a rugged, strong, and powerful brand image. It’s clear the brand, through its marketing, gives you the feeling of being yourself, freedom to travel, living a life without rules. ‍ ‍ Because of the love of the brand, people not only buy their bikes but also tattoo their brand name on themselves. Capitalizing on this, the brand ventured into merchandise — selling t-shirts, socks, cigarette lighters, and more. All of them were tailored towards the masculine and powerful nature of the brand. ‍ ‍ The brand made a major misstep by introducing Harley Davidson’s range of perfume and aftershave products. Their goal was more products equals more sales. That holds true for a while until the brand value and loyalty start declining. It ends up diluting the brand, resulting in the production of inferior products that tarnish the brand’s name in the future. In the 1990s, they continued to alienate their customers through products such as wine coolers, perfumes, infant clothes, ties, and so on. ‍ ‍ Charles E Brymer, CEO of Interbrand Group, said. “ Harley Davidson values are strong, masculine, very rugged values. For them to go into a sector that doesn’t live up to what those values would be disastrous” The brand since then realized their mistake and the effects of this misstep were a limited one. ‍ Lessons from Harley Davidson Never lose sight of your brand values: If your brand values are strong, rugged, and freedom-to-explore in nature, you shouldn’t be selling perfumes and kid’s clothes. That’s where Harley Davidson messed up. It went away from its values and slowly alienated its existing loyal fan base. ‍ ‍ A brand’s foundation is built on its values. Brands can evolve over time, but their values should not change. The primary driving force behind your brand, business, behaviors, and decisions are your core values; these uncompromising truths and principles define who you are. You are guided i"}

Big, tough, mean looking guys cruising on chromed up beasts of motorcycles, right? Now, what character traits come to mind when you think of a Harley bike? Masculine, all-american, rebellious and independent. This is the value of brand: the feelings and emotions evoked by a name, a logo, or even the thought of a company and their products. Brand value accumulates over time, building upon the experiences and contact customers have with the brand. In the case of Harley Davidson, brand equity has amassed to such a level that the brand is consistently ranked in the top 100 brands of the world. In 2013, the brand alone was worth $4 billion, placed as the 96th most valuable brand on the planet. In fact, the licensing of the Harley-Davidson brand and logo accounted for $40 million of the company's net revenue in 2010. The feelings associated with the brand have a powerful impact on the way customers live their lives, with many enthusiasts going to extremes like tattooing the corporate logo on their bodies. Through their association the branded motorcycles, fans channel the values and characteristics of Harley Davidson; they use the brand to express their identity‚Äîbut, this isn't really news is it. What's the big deal? ‚Äç The Harley brand is experienced and expressed through product design The very specific aesthetic and emotion conjured by the Harley Davidson brand is exactly why their announcement of the Project Livewire Experience caused such a ruckus. For their first electric motorcycle prototype, fans and media alike were up in arms: blinged-out heavy cruiser bikes are what Harley does. It goes against everything Harley had spent the last 110 years building and positioning the brand around. Where‚Äôs the classic Harley rumble and rebellion in an electric bike? How can they diverge so extremely from their storied legacy? In actuality, the EV (electric vehicle) is a very logical progression along Harley's trajectory for the brand since 2007. In fact, the heavy cruiser focused brand that the Livewire detractors know and love has only really been around since the early 80s. In response to the backlash against Project Livewire, Motorcycle USA published a well-researched piece on the brand history in terms of physical styles and sizes. Harley used to make every kind of motorcycle: from scooters to sportbikes, not just heavy cruisers. They also weren‚Äôt as ‚Äòall-American‚Äô as their marketing may lead you to believe, since they owned an Italian and a Japanese sub-brand respectively, and even outsourced their manufacturing to Japan for a while. In 1981 however, a collection of Harley executives led by Vaughn Beals bought the brand from holding company AMF (American Machine Foundry) discontinuing most of the brand‚Äôs product lines, and radically re-invented the brand. These executives recognized the so-called ‚ÄòJapanese Invasion‚Äô of the motorcycle industry, especially in the lightweight class, so they set out to create a more competitive brand. The new and improved Harley focused on patriotic, American‚Äîbordering on xenophobic‚Äîmessaging of the type we all recognize today. Coupled with their new product line of highway cruiser bikes based on the new heavy duty Evolution motor, the brand was positioned to differentiate itself from the Japanese brands taking over the lightweight market. And the positioning worked‚Ä¶ up until around 2008 when Harley ran into trouble once again. There were two factors at play which affected sales. The financial crisis in the banking sector was the first. No longer did people have access to easy credit to indulge in a $20,000 weekender bike or have the cash to fill up a large gas tank. Instead, budget conscious consumers needed a cheaper, fuel-efficient bike more practical for commuting. The Harley brand still represented independence, but high spending wasn‚Äôt something most Americans could afford anymore. Another challenge for was the demograp"}

Overview of Harley-Davidson’s Brand Identity Harley-Davidson is more than a motorcycle manufacturer; it’s a symbol of freedom, adventure, and rebellion. The Importance of Brand Communities The company has built a unique identity that resonates deeply with its customers. Riders don’t just purchase a bike; they embrace a lifestyle and a set of values that Harley-Davidson represents. At the heart of Harley-Davidson’s success is its strong brand community , which has transformed customers into loyal advocates. The Harley Owners Group (H.O.G.), established in 1983, is one of the largest manufacturer-sponsored motorcycle clubs worldwide, with over one million members across 25 countries. By fostering connections through events, rides, and shared experiences, Harley-Davidson has created a tight-knit community that supports and promotes the brand. Brand communities like Harley-Davidson’s provide a platform for customers to connect with each other, similar to thriving online communities that enhance the overall customer experience. These communities also offer valuable insights into customer needs and preferences, helping businesses refine their products and strategies. For Harley-Davidson, the community has been instrumental in overcoming challenges and achieving growth, leading to high customer loyalty and organic word-of-mouth promotion. How Harley-Davidson Created a Strong Brand Community: 3 Essential Ingredients Harley-Davidson’s journey from economic challenges in the 1980s to building a strong brand community offers valuable insights. 1. Tapping Into the Core Values of it Audience At the heart of Harley-Davidson’s success is a deep connection to core values like freedom, adventure, and the spirit of the open road. These ideals resonated with riders looking for more than just motorcycles. By embracing these values, Harley-Davidson created a shared identity that united customers under a common banner, fostering a strong sense of loyalty and community among customers. 2. Creating a Sense of Belonging To strengthen this community, Harley-Davidson established the Harley Owners Group (H.O.G.) in 1983. H.O.G. became one of the largest manufacturer-sponsored motorcycle clubs globally, offering members: Organized rides and events Exclusive merchandise A dedicated magazine Roadside assistance These offerings provided riders with opportunities to connect, share experiences, and build relationships using effective community tactics for growth . Annual rallies like the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally and local chapter meetups fostered interpersonal connections, making riders feel part of a family. Harley-Davidson also encouraged members to form local chapters linked to dealerships, utilizing community tactics for growth to allow for community expansion while maintaining a connection to the brand. 3. Engaging with Customers Harley-Davidson actively engaged with its community by involving employees at all levels. Executives and staff participated in rides and events, listening to customer feedback firsthand. This engagement allowed the company to gather valuable insights for product development, build trust with customers, and ensure that the brand evolved with the needs of its community. By closely monitoring these interactions, they could track engagement growth and adjust strategies accordingly. Harley-Davidson also promoted customization and self-expression. By encouraging customers to personalize their motorcycles, they allowed riders to express themselves, strengthening the bond between the individual and the brand. Events and Gatherings That Foster Connections Between Members Harley-Davidson knows that bringing riders together strengthens their community.
